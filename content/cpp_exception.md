# introduction
Zero-overhead is not zero cost, Hutter proposal one determintic-exception, but Bjarne Stroutrup is negative about it.

The origins of exception handling lie in the problems experienced managing a variety of error-handling approaches, such as **Câ€™s errno, error-states, callbacks, return codes, and return objects**. In addition, it was observed that there were no really good approaches to reporting errors detected in constructors and in operators.

# overview
1. SjLj(setjump-longjump)
   It is simpler to implement but has more runtime overhead, and now is deprecated in modern compiler.
2. table-based (zero-overhead)
   - .eh_frame
   - .gcc_except_table
