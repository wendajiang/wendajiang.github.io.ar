decorator pattern\n\nstructural pattern, it allows a behavior to be added to an object\nThe decorator implements the interface of the original class and forwards the requests from its own interface to that class, but it also performs additional actions before and after these forwarded requests -- these are the decorations.\n\n// original class\nclass Unit {\n  public:\n    Unit(double strength, double armor): strength_(strength), armor_(armor) {}\n    virtual bool hit(Unit&amp; target) { return attack() &gt; target.defense(); }\n    virtual double attack() = 0;\n    virtual double defense()

enemy's weak armor, will successfully hit the ogre. But the game is far from over. As the units fight, the surviving ones gain experience and eventually become veterans. A veteran unit is still the same kind of unit, but it gains attack and defense bonuses, reflecting its combat experience.\nWe do not want to change any of the class interfaces, but we want to modify the behavior of the attack() and defense() functions. This is the job of the decorator pattern, and what follows is the classic implementation of the VeteranUnit decorator:\nclass VeteranUnit : public Unit {     \n  public:     \n    VeteranUnit(Unit&amp; unit, double strength_bonus, double armor_bonus) :\n        Unit(strength_bonus, armor_bonus), unit_(unit) {}     \n    double attack() { return unit_.attack() + strength_; }     \n    double defense() { return unit_.defense() + armor_; }     \n  private:     \n    Unit&amp; unit_; \n};\n\n// use\nKnight k(10, 5);\nOgre o(12, 2);\nVeteranUnit vk(k, 7, 2);\nVeteranUnit vo(o, 1, 9);\nvk.hit(vo); // another hit!\n\nVeteranUnit vvo(vo, 1, 9);\nvk.hit(voo); // miss\n// we can decorate a decorated object in this design!\n\nthe classic decorator pattern limitation\n\nthe lifetimes of these objects must be carefully managed\nto C++\n\nwhen designer have added a special ability to the Knight unit, but the VeteranUnit decorator do not know the added ability\ncan't handle cross-casting well(casting to a type in another branch of the same hierarchy)\n\n\n\nDecorators the C++ way\nTo solve the two problem, we indorduct the CRTP C++ idiom\ntemplate &lt;typename U&gt; \nclass VeteranUnit : public U {     \n  public:     \n    VeteranUnit(U&amp;&amp; unit, double strength_bonus, double armor_bonus) :         \n      U(unit), strength_bonus_(strength_bonus), armor_bonus_(armor_bonus)     {}     \n    double attack() { return U::attack() + strength_bonus_; }     \n    double defense() { return U::defense() + armor_bonus_; }     \n  private:     \n    double strength_bonus_;     \n    double armor_bonus_; \n};\n\n// using\nKnight k(10, 5); \nOgre o(12, 2); \nk.hit(o);        // Hit! \nVeteranUnit&lt;Knight&gt; vk(std::move(k), 7, 2); \nVeteranUnit&lt;Ogre&gt; vo(std::move(o), 1, 9); vk.hit(vo);      // Hit! \nVeteranUnit&lt;VeteranUnit&lt;Ogre&gt;&gt; vvo(std::move(vo), 1, 9); \nvk.hit(vvo);     // Miss...\nvk.charge();     // Compiles now, vk is a Knight too , this is the Knight added ability, and now is ok\nvk.hit(vvo);     // Hit with the charge bonus!\n\nThis preservation of the interface is a fundamental feature of the Decorator pattern. It is also one of its most serious limitations.\nadapter pattern\nIt is a sturctural pattern that allows an interface of a class to be used as another, different interface. It allows an existing class to be used in code that expects a different interface, without modifying the original class.\nAdapter is very general, broad pattern. It can be used to implement several other, more narrowly defined patterns -- in particular, the decorator.\nConverting an object from its current interface to the interface needed by a particular application, without rewriting the object itself, is the purpose and the use of the Adapter pattern.\n\nclass adapter\nfunction adapter (std::bind)\n\ncompile-time adapters\n","id":"https://wendajiang.github.io/adapters-and-decorators/","title":"Adapters and Decorators"},"https://wendajiang.github.io/archive/":{"body":"","id":"https://wendajiang.github.io/archive/","title":"Archive"},"https://wendajiang.github.io/async-what-is-blocking/":{"body":"\nThe Post\nRust 中的 async/await 特性使用被称为协作调度的机制实现，这对编写 Rust async 代码的开发者有些重要影响。\n这篇 post 的用户是 async 代码的新手。我会使用  Tokio 运行时作为例子，但是这里提出的观点适合任何异步运行时。\n如果你只需要从这篇 post 记住一点，就是：\n\nasync 代码在不运行 .await 不能花费过长的时间\n\nBlocking vs. non-blocking code\nThe naive way to write an application that works on many things at the same time is to spawn a new thread for every task. If the number of tasks is small, this is a perfectly fine solution, but as the number of tasks becomes large, you will eventually run into problems due to the large number of threads. There are various solutions to this problem in different programming languages, but they all boil down to the same thing: very quickly swap out the currently running task on each thread, such that all of the tasks get an opportunity to run. In Rust, this swapping happens when you .await something.\nWhen writing async Rust, the phrase “blocking the thread” means “preventing the runtime from swapping the current task”. This can be a major issue because it means that other tasks on the same runtime will stop running until the thread is no longer being blocked. To prevent this, we should write code that can be swapped quickly, which you do by never spending a long time away from an .await.\nLet's take an example:\nuse std::time::Duration;\n\n#[tokio::main]\nasync fn main() {\n    println!(\"Hello World!\");\n\n    // No .await here!\n    std::thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(5));\n\n    println!(\"Five seconds later...\");\n}\n\nThe above code looks correct, and if you run it, it will appear to work. But it has a fatal flaw: it is blocking the thread. In this case, there are no other tasks, so it's not a problem, but this wont be the case in real programs. To illustrate this point, consider the following example:\nuse std::time::Duration;\n\nasync fn sleep_then_print(timer: i32) {\n    println!(\"Start timer {}.\", timer);\n\n    // No .await here!\n    std::thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(1));\n\n    println!(\"Timer {} done.\", timer);\n}\n\n#[tokio::main]\nasync fn main() {\n    // The join! macro lets you run multiple things concurrently.\n    tokio::join!(\n        sleep_then_print(1),\n        sleep_then_print(2),\n        sleep_then_print(3),\n    );\n}\n\n// result\nStart timer 1.\nTimer 1 done.\nStart timer 2.\nTimer 2 done.\nStart timer 3.\nTimer 3 done.\n\nThe example will take three seconds to run, and the timers will run one after the other with no concurrency whatsoever. The reason is simple: the Tokio runtime was not able to swap one task for another, because such a swap can only happen at an .await. Since there is no .await in sleep_then_print, no swapping can happen while it is running.\nHowever if we instead use Tokio's sleep function, which uses an .await to sleep, the function will behave correctly:\nuse tokio::time::Duration;\n\nasync fn sleep_then_print(timer: i32) {\n    println!(\"Start timer {}.\", timer);\n\n    tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_secs(1)).await;\n//                                            ^ execution can be paused here\n\n    println!(\"Timer {} done.\", timer);\n}\n\n#[tokio::main]\nasync fn main() {\n    // The join! macro lets you run multiple things concurrently.\n    tokio::join!(\n        sleep_then_print(1),\n        sleep_then_print(2),\n        sleep_then_print(3),\n    );\n}\nStart timer 1.\nStart timer 2.\nStart timer 3.\nTimer 1 done.\nTimer 2 done.\nTimer 3 done.\n\nThe code runs in just one second, and properly runs all three functions at the same time as desired.\nBe aware that it is not always this obvious. By using tokio::join!, all three tasks are guaranteed to run on the same thread, but if you replace it with tokio::spawn and use a multi-threaded runtime, you will be able to run multiple blocking tasks until you run out of threads. The default Tokio runtime spawns one thread per CPU core, and you will typically have around 8 CPU cores. This is enough that you can miss the issue when testing locally, but sufficiently few that you will very quickly run out of threads when running the code for real.\nTo give a sense of scale of how much time is too much, a good rule of thumb is no more than 10 to 100 microseconds between each .await. That said, this depends on the kind of application you are writing.\nWhat if I want to block?\nSometimes we just want to block the thread. This is completely normal. There are two common reasons for this:\n\nExpensive CPU-bound computation.\nSynchronous IO.\n\nIn both cases, we are dealing with an operation that prevents the task from reaching an .await for an extended period of time. To solve this issue, we must move the blocking operation to a thread outside of Tokio's thread pool. There are three variations on this:\n\nUse the tokio::task::spawn_blocking function.\nUse the rayon crate.\nSpawn a dedicated thread with std::thread::spawn.\n\nLet us go through each solution to see when we should use it.\nThe spawn_blocking function\nThe Tokio runtime includes a separate thread pool specifically for running blocking functions, and you can spawn tasks on it using spawn_blocking. This thread pool has an upper limit of around 500 threads, so you can spawn quite a lot of blocking operations on this thread pool.\nSince the thread pool has so many threads, it is best suited for blocking IO such as interacting with the file system or using a blocking database library such as diesel.\nThe thread pool is poorly suited for expensive CPU-bound computations, since it has many more threads than you have CPU cores on your computer. CPU-bound computations run most efficiently if the number of threads is equal to the number of CPU cores. That said, if you only need a few CPU-bound computations, I wont blame you for running them on spawn_blocking as it is quite simple to do so.\n#[tokio::main]\nasync fn main() {\n    // This is running on Tokio. We may not block here.\n\n    let blocking_task = tokio::task::spawn_blocking(|| {\n        // This is running on a thread where blocking is fine.\n        println!(\"Inside spawn_blocking\");\n    });\n\n    // We can wait for the blocking task like this:\n    // If the blocking task panics, the unwrap below will propagate the\n    // panic.\n    blocking_task.await.unwrap();\n}\n\nThe rayon crate\nThe rayon crate is a well known library that provides a thread pool specifically intended for expensive CPU-bound computations, and you can use it for this purpose together with Tokio. Unlike spawn_blocking, the rayon thread pool has a small maximum number of threads, which is why it is suitable for expensive computations.\nWe will use the sum of a large list as an example of an expensive computation, but note that in practice, unless the array is very very large, just computing a sum is probably cheap enough that you can just do it directly in Tokio.\nThe main danger of using rayon is that you must be careful not to block the thread while waiting for rayon to complete. To do this, combine rayon::spawn with tokio::sync::oneshot like this:\nasync fn parallel_sum(nums: Vec&lt;i32&gt;) -&gt; i32 {\n    let (send, recv) = tokio::sync::oneshot::channel();\n\n    // Spawn a task on rayon.\n    rayon::spawn(move || {\n        // Perform an expensive computation.\n        let mut sum = 0;\n        for num in nums {\n            sum += num;\n        }\n\n        // Send the result back to Tokio.\n        let _ = send.send(sum);\n    });\n\n    // Wait for the rayon task.\n    recv.await.expect(\"Panic in rayon::spawn\")\n}\n\n#[tokio::main]\nasync fn main() {\n    let nums = vec![1; 1024 * 1024];\n    println!(\"{}\", parallel_sum(nums).await);\n}\n\nThis uses the rayon thread pool to run the expensive operation. Be aware that the above example uses only one thread in the rayon thread pool per call to parallel_sum. This makes sense if you have many calls to parallel_sum in your application, but it is also possible to use rayon's parallel iterators to compute the sum on several threads:\nuse rayon::prelude::*;\n\n// Spawn a task on rayon.\nrayon::spawn(move || {\n    // Compute the sum on multiple threads.\n    let sum = nums.par_iter().sum();\n\n    // Send the result back to Tokio.\n    let _ = send.send(sum);\n});\n\nNote that you still need the rayon::spawn call when you use parallel iterators, because parallel iterators are blocking.\nSpawn a dedicated thread\nIf a blocking operation keeps running forever, you should run it on a dedicated thread. For example consider a thread that manages a database connection using a channel to receive database operations to perform. Since this thread is listening on that channel in a loop, it never exits.\nRunning such a task on either of the two other thread pools is a problem, because it essentially takes away a thread from the pool permanently. Once you've done that a few times, you have no more threads in the thread pool and all other blocking tasks fail to get executed.\nOf course you can also use dedicated threads for shorter lived purposes if you are okay with paying the cost of spawning a new thread every time you start a new one.\nSummary\nIn case you forgot, here's the main thing you need to remember:\n\nAsync code should never spend a long time without reaching an .await.\n\nBelow you will find a cheat sheet of what methods you can use when you want to block:\nCPU-bound computationSynchronous IORunning forever\nspawn_blockingSuboptimalOKNo\nrayonOKNoNo\nDedicated threadOKOKOK\n\nFinally, I recommend checking out the chapter on shared state from the Tokio tutorial. This chapter explains how you can correctly use std::sync::Mutex in async code, and goes more in-depth with why this is okay even though locking a mutex is blocking. (Spoiler: if you block for a short time, is it really blocking?)\nI also strongly recommend the article Reducing tail latencies with automatic cooperative task yielding from the Tokio blog.\n","id":"https://wendajiang.github.io/async-what-is-blocking/","title":"【翻译】async what is blocking"},"https://wendajiang.github.io/atomic-and-memory-order/":{"body":"reprint\nProblem\nFirst, let's look at the code, and what is the output of the follow code ?\n#include &lt;thread&gt;\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;\nint main() {\n  int a = 0;\n  volatile int flag = 0;\n  std::thread t1([&amp;]() {\n    while(flag != 1);\n    int b = a;\n    std::cout &lt;&lt; \"b = \" &lt;&lt; b &lt;&lt; std::endl;\n  });\n  std::thread t2([&amp;]() {\n    a = 5;\n    flag = 1;\n  });\n  t1.join();\n  t2.join();\n  return 0;\n}\n\nIntuitively, it seems that a=5, in t2 always executes before flag = 1, and while(flag != 1) in t1. It looks like there is a guarantee the line std::cout &lt;&lt; \"b = \" &lt;&lt; b &lt;&lt; std::endl; will not be executed before the mark is changed. Logically, the value of b is 5. But the code behavior is undefined. Out-of-order execution of the CPU and the impact of the compiler on the rearrangement of instructions. Cause a = 5 to occur after flag = 1. Thus b maybe output 0.\nAtomic operation\nstd::mutex can solve the problem of concurrent read and write, but the mutext is an operating system-level function. This is because the implementation of a mutex usually contains two basic principles:\n\nprovide automatic state transition between threads, that is , \"lock\" state\nEnsure that the memory of the manipulated variable is isolated from the critical section during the mutex operation.\n\nThis is a very strong set of synchronization conditions, in other words when it is finally compiled into a CPU instruction, it will behave like a lot of instructions.\nWe should understand that under the modern CPU architecture, atomic operations at the CPU instruction level are provided. Therefore, int the C++11 multi-threaded shared variable reading and writing, the introduction of the std::atomic template, so that we instantiate an atomic type, will be an Atomic type read and write operations are minimized from a set of instructions to a single CPU instruction.\nOf course, not all types provide atomic operations because the feasibility of atomic operations depends on the architecture of the CPU and whether the type structure being instantiated satisfies the memory alignment requirements of the architecture, so we can always pass std::atomic&lt;T&gt;::is_lock_free to check if the atom type needs to support atomic operations, for example:\n#include &lt;atomic&gt;\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;\nstruct A {\n  float x;\n  int y;\n  long long z;\n}\nint main() {\n  std::atomic&lt;A&gt; a;\n  std::cout &lt;&lt; std::boolalpha &lt;&lt; a.is_lock_free() &lt;&lt; std::endl;\n  return 0;\n}\n\nConsistency model\nMutliple threads executing in parallel, discussed at some macro level, can be roughly considered a distributed system. In a distributed system, any communication or even local operation takes a certain amount of time, and even unreliable communication occurs.\nIf we force the operation of a variable v between multiple threads to be atomic, that is, any thread after the operation of v, other threads can syncchronize to perceive changes in v, for the variable v, which appears as a sequential execution of the program, it does not have any efficiency gains due to the introduction of multithreading. Is there any way to accelerate this properly? The answer is to weaken the sychronization conditions between processes in atomic operations.\nIn principle, each thread can correspond to a cluster node, and the communication between threads is almost equivalent to communication between cluster node. Weakening the synchronization conditions between processes, usually we will consider four different consistency models:\nLinear consistency\nAlso known as strong consistency or atomic consistency. It requires that any read operation can read the most recent write of a certain data, the the order of operation of all threads is consistent with the order under the global clock.\n        x.store(1)      x.load()\nT1 ---------+----------------+------&gt;\n\n\nT2 -------------------+-------------&gt;\n                x.store(2)\n\nThread T1 , T2 is twice atomic to x, and x.store(1) is strictly before x.store(2), x.store(2) strictly occurs before x.load(). It is worth mentioning that linear consistency requirements for global clocks are difficult to achieve, which is why people continue to study other consistent algorithms under this weaker consistency.\nSequential consistency\nIt is also required that any read operation can read the last data writen by the data, but it is not required to be consistent to be consistent with the order of the global clock.\n        x.store(1)  x.store(3)   x.load()\nT1 ---------+-----------+----------+-----&gt;\n\n\nT2 ---------------+----------------------&gt;\n              x.store(2)\n\nor\n\n        x.store(1)  x.store(3)   x.load()\nT1 ---------+-----------+----------+-----&gt;\n\n\nT2 ------+-------------------------------&gt;\n      x.store(2)\n\nunder the order consistency requirement, x.load() must read the last written data, so x.store(2) and x.store(1) do not have any guarantees, as long as x.store(2) of T2 occur before x.store(3).\nCausal consistency\nIt requirements are further reduced, only the sequence of causal operations is guaranteed, and the order of non-causal operations is not required.\n      a = 1      b = 2\nT1 ----+-----------+----------------------------&gt;\n\n\nT2 ------+--------------------+--------+--------&gt;\n      x.store(3)         c = a + b    y.load()\n\nor\n\n      a = 1      b = 2\nT1 ----+-----------+----------------------------&gt;\n\n\nT2 ------+--------------------+--------+--------&gt;\n      x.store(3)          y.load()   c = a + b\n\nor\n\n     b = 2       a = 1\nT1 ----+-----------+----------------------------&gt;\n\n\nT2 ------+--------------------+--------+--------&gt;\n      y.load()            c = a + b  x.store(3)\n\nThe three examples given above are all causal consistent as, in the whole process, only c has a dependency on a and b, and x and y are not related in this example.\nFinal consistency\nIt is the weakest consistency requirement. It only guarantees that an operation will be observed at a certain point in the future, but does not require the observed time. So we can strenthen this condition a bit, for example, to specify that the time observed for an operation is always bounded. Of course, this is no longer within our discussion.\n    x.store(3)  x.store(4)\nT1 ----+-----------+--------------------------------------------&gt;\n\n\nT2 ---------+------------+--------------------+--------+--------&gt;\n         x.read()      x.read()           x.read()   x.read()\n\nIn the above case, if we assume that the initial value of x is 0, then the four times x.read() in T2 maybe but not limited to the following:\n3 4 4 4 // The write operation of x was quickly observed\n0 3 3 4 // There is a delay in the observed time of the x write operation\n0 0 0 4 // The last read read the final value of x, \n        // but the previous changes were not observed.\n0 0 0 0 // The write operation of x is not observed in the current time period, \n        // but the situation that x is 4 can be observed \n        // at some point in the future.\n\nMemory order\nTo achieve the ultimate performance and achieve consistency of various strength requirements, C++11 defines six different memory sequences for atomic operations. The option std::memory_order expresses four synchronization models between multiple threads:\nRelaxed model\nUnder this model, atomic operations within a single thread are executed sequentially, and instruction recordering is not allowed, but the order of atomic operations between different threads is arbitrary. The type is specified by std::memory_order_relaxed\nstd::atomic&lt;int&gt; counter = {0};\nstd::vector&lt;std::thread&gt; vt;\nfor (int i = 0; i &lt; 100; ++i) {\n    vt.emplace_back([&amp;](){\n        counter.fetch_add(1, std::memory_order_relaxed);\n    });\n}\n\nfor (auto&amp; t : vt) {\n    t.join();\n}\nstd::cout &lt;&lt; \"current counter:\" &lt;&lt; counter &lt;&lt; std::endl;\n\nRlease/consumption model\nIn this model, we begin to limit the order of operations between processes. If a thread needs to modify a value, but another thread will have a dependency on that opertion of the value, that is, the latter depends on the former. Specifically, thread A has completed three writes to x, and thread B relies only on the third x wrtie operation, regardless of the first two write behaviors of x, then A when active x.release()(ie using std::memory_order_release), the option std::memory_order_consume ensures that B observes A when calling x.load().\n// initialize as nullptr to prevent consumer load a dangling pointer\nstd::atomic&lt;int*&gt; ptr(nullptr);\nint v;\nstd::thread producer([&amp;]() {\n  int *p = new int(42);\n  v = 1024;\n  ptr.store(p, std::memory_order_release);\n});\nstd::thread consumer([&amp;]() {\n    int* p;\n    while(!(p = ptr.load(std::memory_order_consume)));\n\n    std::cout &lt;&lt; \"p: \" &lt;&lt; *p &lt;&lt; std::endl;\n    std::cout &lt;&lt; \"v: \" &lt;&lt; v &lt;&lt; std::endl;\n});\nproducer.join();\nconsumer.join();\n\nRelease/acquire model\nUnder this model, we can further tighten the order of atomic operations between different threads, specifying the timing between releasing std::memory_order_release and getting std::memory_order_acquire. All write operations before the release operation is visible to any other thread, i.e., happends before.\nAs you can see, std::memory_order_release ensures that a write before a release does not occur after the release operation, which is backward barrier, and std::memory_order_acquire ensures that a subsequent read or write after a acquire does not occur before the acquire operation, which is forward barrier. For the std::memory_order_acq_rel option, combines the charateristics of the two barriers and determines a unique memory barrier, such that reads and writes of the current thread will not be rearranged across the barrier.\nstd::vector&lt;int&gt; v;\nstd::atomic&lt;int&gt; flag = {0};\nstd::thread release([&amp;]() {\n    v.push_back(42);\n    flag.store(1, std::memory_order_release);\n});\nstd::thread acqrel([&amp;]() {\n    int expected = 1; // must before compare_exchange_strong\n    while(!flag.compare_exchange_strong(expected, 2, std::memory_order_acq_rel)) \n        expected = 1; // must after compare_exchange_strong\n    // flag has changed to 2\n});\nstd::thread acquire([&amp;]() {\n    while(flag.load(std::memory_order_acquire) &lt; 2);\n\n    std::cout &lt;&lt; v.at(0) &lt;&lt; std::endl; // must be 42\n});\nrelease.join();\nacqrel.join();\nacquire.join();\n\nIn this case, we used compare_exchange_strong, which is the Compare-and-swap primitive, which has a weaker version, compare_exchange_weak, which allows a failure to be returned even if the exchange is successful. The reason is due to a false failure on some platforms, specifically when the CPU performs a context switch, another threads loads the same address to produce an inconsistency. In addition, the performance of compare_exchange_strong maybe slightly worse than compare_exchange_weak. However, in mose cases, compare_exchange_weak is discouraged due to the complexity of its usage.\nSequential consistent model\nUnder this model, atomic operations satisfy sequence consistency, which in turn can cause performance loss. It can be specified explicityly by std::memory_order_seq_cst.\nstd::atomic&lt;int&gt; counter = {0};\nstd::vector&lt;std::thread&gt; vt;\nfor (int i = 0; i &lt; 100; ++i) {\n    vt.emplace_back([&amp;](){\n        counter.fetch_add(1, std::memory_order_seq_cst);\n    });\n}\n\nfor (auto&amp; t : vt) {\n    t.join();\n}\nstd::cout &lt;&lt; \"current counter:\" &lt;&lt; counter &lt;&lt; std::endl;\n\nThis example is essentially the same as the first loose model example. Just change the memory order of the atomic operation to memory_order_seq_cst.\nfurther reading\n\nc++ concurrency in

https://github.com/douban/gobeansdb\nBitcask 的起源与 Riak 分布式数据库的历史联系在一起。在 Riak 的 key/value 集群中，每个节点都使用插件化的本地存储；几乎任何 k/v 形式的引擎都可以来用。这种插件化的设计可以使 Riak 并行化使得存储引擎可以在不影响其他代码的情况下单独升级和测试。\n已经存在很多这种 key/value 存储引擎，包括但不限于 Berkeley DB，Tokyo Cabinet, Innostore。在评估此类引擎时，我们考虑了许多目标，包括：\n\n每条数据读写的低延迟\n高吞吐，尤其是随机写入\n处理远大于 RAM 吞吐能力的数据集的能力\ncrash 友好性，不管是快速恢复还是不丢失数据\n容易备份和恢复\n简单，易理解的代码结构和数据格式\n在重负载和大规模下的行为可预知\nRiak 易于使用的 license\n\n实现其中的一些是容易的，但是实现所有特性很难。\n就上述所有目标而言，没有现成的 key/value 存储系统。我们就这个问题与 Eric Brewer 进行讨论，他提出了一个关键 idea: hash table log merging: 这样做可能比 LSM-trees 快得多。\n这促使我们以全新的视角探索了在 1980 和 1990 年代首次开发的 log-structured file system 中使用的一些技术。这次探索引出了 Bitcask   的发展，实现了所有上述特性。当 Bitcask 被作为 Riak 的底层为目标开发出来后，可以作为一个本地 key/value 存储引擎通用于其他应用。\n最终使用的模型非常简单。一个 Bitcask 实例是一个目录，同一时间只有一个操作系统进程写入 Bitcask。你可以将此进程看做 database server。任何时候，只有一个文件是“活动的”，可以被服务器写入。当文件大小达到阈值，就会被关闭，然后一个新的“活动”文件就被创建出来。一旦文件被关闭，或者由于服务器关闭导致文件被关闭，该文件就被视为不可变的，不会再被服务器写入。模型如下图所示：\n\n\n“活动”文件只能被追加写，这意味着磁盘不需要寻道，数据格式如下：\n\n\n每次写入，文件尾部被追加一条记录。请注意，删除只是写入一个特殊的逻辑删除值，在下一次归并时会被删除。因此，Bitcask 数据文件就像下面的线性条目序列：\n\n\n在每次追加后，内存中的数据结构被称为 \"keydir\" 会被更新。\"keydir\" 是一个 hash table ，描述了 Bitcask 中每个 key 的位置（固定结构）（file, offset, value size）\n\n\n（译者注：file_id表示哪个文件，value_pos 表示offset， 以及value size表示从value_pos取多少数据）\n当发生写入时，'keydir' 自动根据最新数据更新，老数据仍然存在与硬盘中，但是读取使用 'keydir' 记录的最新版本的数据信息。正如稍后我们看到的，归并过程会删除老数据。\n读取数据很简单，不会超过一次硬盘寻道。我们在 'keydir' 中查找数据的 key 位置，然后使用获得的 file_id, value_pos, value_sz 直接读取数据。在很多情况下，操作系统的文件系统预读高速缓存使此操作比预期要快得多，读取过程如下图\n\n\n这个简单的过程会随着使用时间占用越来越多的存储空间，因为我们一直在写入新数据。一个单独的“归并”进程用来解决这个问题，“归并”进程遍历所有“不活动”数据文件，然后生成一组只包含“活动”数据的文件。\n完成此操作之后，我们将在每个数据文件旁创建一个“hint file”，包含对应数据文件的位置和值的大小。\n\n\n当 Bitcask 被 Erlang 进程打开时，会检查是否已经有其他进程已经打开当前 Bitcask，如果有，就会共享 keydir 信息，如果没有，会扫描所有数据文件，然后重建一个新的 keydir。如果数据文件有 ‘hint file’，可以加速这个重建过程。\n上述就是 Bitcask 基本操作。显然，我们没有在这个文档中阐释所有操作细节；我们的目标是帮你了解 Bitcask 的概况。实际上还有一些细节讨论：\n\n上面提到操作系统文件系统的cache可以提升读性能。我们也讨论了加入 bitcask 内部 cache 提升读性能，但是鉴于还没有实现，所以不清楚有多少回报\n我们会尽快对 Bitcask 的各个接口做基准测试，但是最开始 Bitcask 就不是为了最快，而是在尽可能快的速度下拥有高质量并且简单的代码，设计和文件格式。不过还是要说，在最初的简单基准测试中，许多场景中 Bitcask 已经快于很多快速存储系统\n最困难的实现细节对大多数外人来说也不感兴趣，因此在这份简短的文档中也没有比如 keydir locking 方案的描述\nBitcask 没有对数据进行压缩，因为这样做的成本收益比很大程度上取决于应用\n读写条目的低延迟\nBitcask 非常快。我们计划尽快做基准测试，但是在简单测试中，我们对 bitcask 达到目标很有信息\n高吞吐，尤其是随机写\n笔记本的低速硬盘测试，可以做到每秒 5000-6000 次写入\n处理比 RAM 容量更大的数据集\n上面提到的测试使用了超过 RAM 10倍的数据集，并且行为没有变化，这符合我们对于 Bitcask 设计的期望\ncrash 友好，既能快速恢复又不会丢失数据\n由于数据文件和提交log在 Bitcask 中是一样的，恢复很容易，无需重放，而且 hint file 可以加速重建过程\n易于备份和恢复\n在文件关闭后就不可变，因此备份可以使用操作系统的任何操作，恢复只需要将数据文件放置在所需目录即可\n相对简单，易于理解的代码结构和数据格式\nBitcask 概念很简单，代码整洁，数据文件非常易于理解和管理。\n在负载重或者数据量大的时候行为可预知\n在大量访问负载情况下，我们已经看到 Bitcask 表现出色。到目前为止，只达到了两位数 GB 的数据，但是我们不久之后对其进行测试。Bitcask 的设计让我们预期在大数据量的情况下不会表现出太大不同，唯一可预见的就是 keydir 可能会随着数据量而变大可以会占用更多内存。实践中，这种限制不太有问题，即使存在数百万个 key，也只会占用 GB 级别的内存。\n\n总而言之，鉴于最开始阐述的一组要求，Bitcask 是最适合这些要求的产品。\n","id":"https://wendajiang.github.io/bitcask/","title":"Bitcask: A Log-Structured Hash Table for Fast Key/Value

提供了类似分布式文件系统的接口，设计更强调可用性和可靠性，而不是高性能。很多实例已经用了一些年头，每个服务实例可以处理成千上百万的并发请求。本文章描述初始设计以及使用预期，并与适应实际使用作出的修改作对比。\n1. 介绍\na lock service called Chubby\nlock service 的目的是，可以使能 client 同步它们的逻辑，以及分享它们环境的基本信息。主要设计目标包括，可用性、可靠性以及易于使用，吞吐和存储容量在第二位被考虑。Chubby 的 client 接口就像系统提供的 read 和 write 一样，以及尝试锁和例如文件修改的时间通知。\n我们期望 Chubby 帮助开发者更容易处理分布式系统中的同步事件，尤其是处理类似从多个服务器中选 leader 这种场景，比如 Google File System 使用 Chubby lock 选出一个 GFS 的主服务器，Bigtable 在多个地方使用 Chubby：选主，主服务器的控制指令分发，client 找主。需要额外提到是，GFS 和 Bittable 都使用 Chubby 来存储少量的 meta 数据；实际上，它们使用 Chubby 分布式数据结构的 root。有些服务使用 Chubby lock 来为多个服务器分发任务。\n在 Chubby 被部署之前，多数 Google 的分布式系统使用 ad hoc 方法进行选主（如果任务重复执行没有危害），或者需要操作者进行干预（正确性至关重要）。在前一种情况，Chubby 可以节省计算资源，后一种情况，Chubby 使系统更干净，容易使用。\n熟悉分布式计算的读者知道分布式一致性问题 (distributed consensus) 的选主，并且需要一个异步通信机制 (asynchronous communication)。这个术语描述了真实的网络环境（随时可能发生丢包，延迟或者包乱序）。asynchronous consensus 通过 Paxos 协议解决，实际上，我们见到的所有需要异步一致性的系统核心都有 Paxos 的身影。Paxos 无需时间假设就达到安全性，但是必须引入时钟来保证。\n构建 Chubby 是填补上述需求的工程努力，这不是 research。我们没有声明什么新算法或者新技术。本文的目的是描述我们做了什么，以及为什么要做。后面的章节中，我们描述 Chubby 的设计和实现，以及改变了什么使用体验。描述了使用 Chubby 的意外方式，以及被证明是错误的方式。我们省略了一些细节，比如共识协议或者 RPC 系统的细节。\n2. 设计\n2.1 Retional\n有些人可能会说我们应该建立一个 Paxos 的库，而不是一个集中的锁服务。一个 client paxos library 不依赖其他服务（包括名字服务），可以为开发者提供一个标准框架，假设他们的服务可以被实现为状态机。事实上，我们确实提供了独立与 Chubby 的一个 client library.\n然而，lock service 相比 client library 有几点优势：\n\n首先，我们开发者并不会预期一样考虑高可用性，通常系统以原型启动，使用较少的负载并且没有过多的可用性保证，代码的结构也不方便使用共识协议。当服务开始真正的服务客户端时，可用性变得很重要，复制，选主就要被加到设计中。当然这些可以使用提供了分布式一致性的库做到，但是 lock 服务使得这些变得更容易，不用改变现有的代码结构和通信方式。比如，选主然后写到文件服务需要添加两个状态和一个 RPC 参数到现有系统：一个请求 lock 称为主，传递一个额外的整数（lock acquisition count）到 write RPC，加一个 if 状态来拒绝如果 acquisition count 小于当前值的请求（防止包延迟导致问题）。我们发现这种技术方案比在服务中引入共识协议更简单，尤其是还要在过渡期间维护兼容性\n我们的一些服务，比如选主或者在组件之间分割数据需要一个机制来发布结果。所有我们需要 client 可以存储，拉取少量数据--就是读写小文件。这可以使用名字服务完成，但是我们的经验告诉我们 lock service 本身就适合完成这个任务，不仅可以减少服务依赖，还因为共识协议的共享特性。 Chubby 成功作为名字服务由于使用一致性的 client 缓存，而不是基于时间的缓存。尤其是，我们发现开发者非常喜欢这种不基于时间的缓存设计，比如基于时间的 DNS 缓存，如果选择不当，可能会导致 DNS 负载过大或者客户端延迟严重。\n开发者更熟悉 lock-based 的接口设计。Paxos 的复制状态机和排它锁可以为开发者提供顺序编程的错觉。但是，很多开发者使用锁，讽刺的是，这样的开发者通常会错误，尤其是在分布式系统中，很少人能考虑独立计算机故障对于异步通信系统中的锁的影响。尽管如此，锁的熟悉说服了开发者利用分布式的可靠机制【译者注：对于分布式系统中的锁服务，也必须使用共识协议，单机的锁，比如简单的 redis 作为分布式锁，如果单机 redis 挂了，对系统的影响是很严重的，比如 redis 作者也意识到了这一点，设计分布式锁给出了 redlock 的方案，关于 redis 分布式锁，可以前往 Redis 分布式锁以及相关讨论】\n最后，分布共识算法使用 Quorums 来决策，所以它们使用多个副本来达到高可用性。比如 Chubby 本身每个 cell 有 5 个副本，至少 3 个运行这个 cell 才可用。相比之下，如果客户端使用 lock service， 即使单个 client 也可以获取 lock。因此 lock service 减少了一个 client 系统所需的服务器数量。\n\n这些讨论引出了两个核心设计决策：\n\n做一个 lock service，而不是提供一个库\n适用小文件，而不是二级服务\n\n根据我们的经验，环境和需求的一些决策：\n\nChubby 有很多客户端，所以要允许成千个 client 看到这个文件，而不需要很多服务器\n客户端和服务的副本需要知道何时发生了切换主节点。这需要事件通知，而不是轮询问\n即使有些客户端不需要周期轮询文件，有些还要需要，所以需要缓存\n很多开发者存在不符合直觉的缓存语义的困惑，我们提供一致性缓存\n为了避免财务损失和监禁，我们提供了安全机制，包括访问控制\n\n一个让读者惊讶的选择是我们没有提供细粒度锁，比如 hold 秒级或者更短时间。比如应用使用 lock 作为选主，将要在接下来的几个小时或者几天，处理所有的数据。这两种使用方式表明了 lock service 的不同要求\n粗粒度锁对锁服务器的负载要小得多。特别是，锁的获取频率通常与客户端应用系统的事务频率只有很微弱的关联。粗粒度的锁很少被获取，所以临时性的锁服务器的不可用给客户端造成的延时会更少。另一方面，锁在客户端间的转移可能需要高昂的恢复处理，所以人们不希望锁服务器的故障恢复导致锁丢失。因此，粗粒度的锁可以很好地应对锁服务器故障，几乎不需要考虑这样做的开销，而且这样的锁允许少量的锁服务器以较低的可用性为许多客户端提供足够的服务。\n细粒度的锁会有不同的结论。即使锁服务器短暂地不可用，也可能导致许多客户端被挂起。因为锁服务的事务频率随着客户端的事务频率之和一起增长，所以性能和随意增加新服务器的能力非常重要。通过不维护跨锁服务器故障的锁来减少锁的开销是有优势的，而且由于锁只会被持有很短的时间，所以偶尔丢弃锁的时间损失并不严重。（客户端必须准备好在网络分区期间丢失锁，所以锁服务器故障恢复造成的锁的丢失不会引入新的恢复路径。)\nChubby 只提供粗粒度的锁定。幸运的是，客户端可以直接实现针对其应用程序定制的细粒度锁。应用程序可以将其锁划分为组，并使用 Chubby 的粗粒度锁将这些锁组分配给应用程序特定的锁服务器。维护这些细粒度的锁只需要很少的状态；服务器只需要保持一个稳定的、单调递增的且很少更新的请求计数器，客户端能够在解锁时发现丢失了的锁，如果使用简单的定长租期 (lease)，协议会变得简单而有效。此方案最重要的好处是，我们的客户端开发人员负责提供支持其负载所需要的服务器，而不必自己去实现共识机制。\n2.2 System structures\nChubby 有两个通过 RPC 通信的主要组件：服务器和客户端应用程序链接的库；如下图。Chubby 客户端和服务器之间的所有通信都由客户端库进行中介。第 3.1 节讨论了可选的第三个组件，即代理服务器\n\n一个 Chubby cell 由一组称为副本 (replicas) 的服务器（通常是 5 个）组成，放置这些服务器是为了减少相关故障的可能性（例如，放在不同的机架上）。副本使用一个分布式共识协议来选举一个 Master ；Master 必须从大多数副本中获得选票，并保证这些副本在 Master 租用的几秒钟内不会选择其他的 Master。主租赁由副本定期更新，前提是主租赁继续赢得多数选票。\n副本维护一个简单数据库的副本集，但是只有 Master 才会发起对数据库的读写。其他所有副本只是复制来自 Master 的更新，使用一致性协议发送。\n客户端通过向 DNS 中列出的副本集发送 Master 位置请求来找到 Master。非主副本通过返回主副本的身份来响应此类请求。一旦客户端找到了 Master，客户端就会将所有请求定向到它，直到它停止响应，或者直到它指出它不再是 Master。写请求通过协商一致性协议传播到所有副本；当写操作到达计算 cell 中的大多数副本时，将确认这些请求。读请求仅由 Master 来满足；这是安全的，只要主租赁没有到期，因为没有其他的 Master 存在。如果 Master 失败，其他副本在其 Master 租约到期时运行选举协议；新的 Master 通常会在几秒钟内选出。例如，最近的两次选举分别花了 6s 和 4s，但我们也见过长达 30s 的情况。\n如果一个副本发生故障，并且几个小时内无法恢复，则简单的替换，系统将从空闲池中选择一台新机器，并启动其上的锁服务器的二进制文件。然后更新 DNS 表，将失败副本的 IP 地址替换为新副本的 IP 地址。当前的 Master 定期轮询 DNS，并最终注意到变化。然后更新 cell 数据库中 cell 成员的列表；这个列表通过正常的复制协议在所有成员之间保持一致。与此同时，新副本从存储在文件服务器上的备份和活动副本的更新组合中获取数据库的最新副本。一旦新副本处理了当前 Master 等待提交的请求，就允许该副本在新 Master 的选举中投票。\n2.3 Files, Directories and handles\nChubby 开放的文件系统接口与 UNIX 类似，但比后者更简单。它通常按照的方式由严格的文件和目录树组成，名称组成部分由斜杠分隔。一个典型的名字是：   /ls/foo/wombat/pouch\nls 前缀对所有 Chubby 的名字都相同，代表锁服务 (lock service)。第二部分 (foo) 是一个 Chubby cell 的名称；它通过 DNS 查询解析为一个或多个 Chubby 服务器。一个特殊的 cell 名称 local，表示应该使用客户端的本地 Chubby cell；这个 Chubby cell 通常在同一栋楼里，因此这个 cell 最有可能能访问到。名字的剩余部分，/wombat/pouch，是在 Chubby cell 内解析的。同样，在 UNIX 下，每个目录包含子文件和子目录的列表，而每个文件包含未解析的字节序列。\n因为 Chubby 的命名结构类似于一个文件系统，所以我们既可以通过专门的 API 将它开放给应用系统，也可以通过我们其他文件系统，例如 GFS 使用的接口。这显著地减少了编写基本的浏览和名字空间操作工具所需的工作，也减少了培训那些偶然使用 Chubby 的用户的需求。\n这种设计使得 Chubby 接口不同于 UNIX 文件系统，它使得分布更容易 (The design differs from UNIX in a ways that easy distribution)。为允许不同目录下的文件由不同的 Chubby master 来服务，我们没有放出那些将文件从一个目录移动到另一个目录的操作，我们不维护目录修改时间，也避开路径相关的权限语义（也就是文件的访问由其本身的权限控制，而不由它上层路径上的目录控制）。 为使缓存文件元数据更容易，系统不公开最后访问时间。\n名称空间只包含文件和目录，统称为节点。每个这样的节点在其 Chubby cell 内只有一个名称；没有符号链接和硬链接。\n节点可以是永久的 (permanent)，也可以是短暂的 (ephemeral)。任意节点都可以被显示地 (explicitly) 删除，但是瞬时节点也会在没有客户端打开它时被删除 （另外，对目录而言，在它们为空时被删除）。短暂的文件被用作临时文件，并作为其他客户端存活的指示器。任意节点都能作为一个意向性 (advisory) 的读写锁；这些锁将在 2.4 节更详细地描述。\n每个节点都有多种元数据，包括访问控制列表 (access control lists，ACLs) 的三个名字，分别用于控制读、写和修改其 ACL。除非被覆盖，否则节点在创建时将继承其父目录的 ACL 名称。ACLs 本身是位于一个 ACL 目录中的文件， 这个 ACL 目录是 Chubby cell 的一个为人熟知的本地名字空间。这些 ACL 文件的内容由简单的访问名字 (principals) 列表组成；读者可能会想起 Plan 9 的 groups 。因此，如果文件 F 的写 ACL 名称是 foo，并且 ACL 目录中包含一个 foo 文件，foo 文件中包含 bar 这个条目，那么用户 bar 就可以写文件 F。用户由内嵌在 RPC 系统里的机制鉴权。因为 Chubby 的 ACLs 是平常的文件，它们自动地就可以由其他想使用类似的访问控制机制的服务访问。\n每个节点的元数据包括四个单调增加的 64 位编号，有利于客户端很容易地检测变化：\n\n实例编号：大于任意先前的同名节点的实例编号。\n内容生成编号（仅限文件）：当写入文件的内容时，这个值会增加。\n锁生成编号：当节点的锁从空闲状态转换到被持有状态时，这个值会增加。\nACL 生成编号：当写入节点的 ACL 名称时，这种情况会增加。\nChubby 还开放了一个 64 位的文件内容校验和，以便客户端可以判断文件是否有变化。\n\n客户端通过打开节点以获得类似于 UNIX 文件描述符的句柄。句柄包括：\n\n校验位：阻止客户端自行创建或猜测句柄，所以完整的访问控制检查只需要在句柄创建时执行（对比 UNIX，UNIX 在打开时检查权限位但在每次读写时不检查，因为文件描述符不能伪造）。\n一个序列号：这个序列号允许 Master 分辨一个句柄是由它或前面的 Master 生成。\n模式信息：在句柄打开时设定的是否允许新 Master 在遇见一个由前面的 Master 创建的旧句柄时重建该句柄的状态。\n\n2.4 Locks and sequencers\n每个 Chubby 文件和目录都可以充当读/写锁：一个客户端句柄可以在独占（写）模式下持有锁，或者任意数量的客户端句柄可以在共享（读）模式下持有锁。就像大多数程序员所知道的互斥锁 (mutexes) 一样，锁是协同锁 (advisory lock)。也就是说，它们只与获取相同锁的其他请求冲突：持有锁 F 既不是访问文件 F 的必要条件，也不会阻止其他客户端访问文件 F。我们舍弃强制锁 (mandatory lock)，因为它使得其他没有持有锁的客户端不能访问被锁定的对象：\n\nChubby 锁通常保护由其他服务实现的资源，而不仅仅是与锁相关的文件。要以一种有意义的方式强制实施强制锁定，我们需要对这些服务进行更广泛的修改。\n我们不希望强制用户在出于调试或管理目的需要访问锁定的文件时关闭应用程序。在复杂的系统中，使用大多数个人计算机上使用的方法比较困难，在这种情况下，管理软件可以通过指示用户关闭其应用程序或重新启动来打破强制锁。\n我们的开发人员以传统的方式执行错误检查，编写诸如 \"持有锁 X\" 之类的断言，因此他们从强制检查中获益甚微。当不持有锁时，有 bug 的或恶意的进程有很多机会破坏数据，所以我们发现强制锁提供的额外保护没有多大价值。\n\n在 Chubby 中，请求任意模式的锁都需要写权限，因而一个无权限的读者不能阻止一个写者的操作。\n在分布式系统中，锁是复杂的，因为通信经常是不确定的，并且进程可能会独立地失败。因此可能会出现这种情况，持有锁 L 的进程可能会发出请求 R，但随后就会失败了。另一个进程可能在 R 获取之前就获得了 L，并执行了一些操作。如果 R 稍后到达，它可能在没有 L 保护的情况下被执行，并且可能对不一致的数据进行操作。接收消息顺序紊乱的问题已经被研究得很彻底：解决方案包括虚拟时间 (virtual time) 和虚拟同步 (virtual synchrony) 后者通过确保与每个参与者的观察一致的顺序处理消息，从而避免了这个问题。\n在现有的复杂系统中，将序列号引入到所有的交互中的成本是很高的。相反，Chubby 提供了一种方法，通过这种方法，序列号只被引入到那些使用锁的交互中。在任何时候，锁的持有者都可以请求一个 sequencer，这是一个不透明的字节串，描述锁在刚获取后的状态。它包含锁的名称、获取锁的模式（独占或共享）以及锁的生成号 ( generation number)。如果客户端希望它的操作受到锁的保护，那么它就会将 sequencer 传递给服务器（例如文件服务器）。接收服务器要做的工作是检测 sequencer 是否仍然有效并具有适当的模式；如果不是，则应拒绝请求。可以根据服务器的 Chubby 缓存来检查 sequencer 的有效性，如果服务器不希望维护与 Chubby 的会话，也可以根据服务器观察到的最近的 sequencer 来检查。sequencer 机制只需要向受影响的消息添加一个字符串，并且很容易向我们的开发人员解释。\n虽然我们发现 sequencer 使用简单，但重要的协议发展缓慢。因此，Chubby 提供了一种不完美但更简单的机制，以减少向不支持 sequencer 的服务器发送延迟或重新排序请求的风险。如果一个客户端以正常的方式释放了一个锁，那么其他客户端就可以立即使用这个锁。但是，如果锁因为持有者停止工作或不可访问而变为空闲状态，则锁服务器将在一段被称为锁延迟 (lock-delay) 的时间段内阻止其他客户端请求锁。客户端可以指定任何锁延迟（目前上限是一分钟）；这个限制可以防止错误的客户端使锁（以及一些资源）在长时间内不可用。虽然不完美，但锁延迟保护未修改的服务器和客户端免受消息延迟和重启造成的日常问题。\n2.5 Events\nChubby 客户端在创建句柄时可能订阅一系列事件。这些事件通过来自 Chubby 库的向上调用被异步传递到客户端。活动包括：\n\n文件内容修改——通常用于监视通过文件发布的服务。\n子节点 added， removed， 或 modified——用于实现镜像。（除了允许发现新文件之外，为子节点返回事件还可以监视临时文件而不影响它们的引用计数。)\nChubby master 故障恢复——警告客户端其他事件可能已经丢失，因此必须重新检查数据。\n句柄（及其锁）已经失效——这通常意味着通信问题。\n锁定获取——可用于判断什么时候 Primary 被选出来了。\n来自另一个客户端的冲突锁请求允许缓存锁。\n\n事件是在相应的操作发生之后被传递的。因此，如果客户端被告知文件内容已经更改，那么它随后读取文件时，保证能看到新数据（或最近的数据）。\n上面提到的最后两种事件很少用到，事后想来，可以忽略不计。例如，在 Primary 选举之后，客户端通常需要与新的 Primary 进行通信，而不是简单地知道 Primary 的存在；因此，它们会等待 Primary 将地址写入文件的文件修改事件。锁冲突事件在理论上允许客户端缓存其他服务器上的数据，使用 Chubby 锁来维护缓存一致性。一个冲突的锁请求将会告诉客户端结束使用与锁相关的数据：它将结束进行等待的操作、将修改刷新到原来的位置 (home location)、丢弃缓存的数据并释放锁。到目前为止，还没有人采用这种方式。\n2.6 API\n客户端将一个 Chubby 的句柄视为一个指向支持各种操作的不透明结构的指针。句柄仅由 Open() 创建，Close() 销毁。\nOpen() 打开指定的文件或目录以生成句柄，类似于 UNIX 文件描述符。只有这个调用使用节点名；其他的调用都在句柄上操作。\n相对于现有的目录句柄计算名称；库提供了一个始终有效的 \"/\" 句柄。目录句柄避免了在包含许多抽象层的多线程程序中使用程序范围内的当前目录的困难 (Directory handles avoid the difficulties of using a program-wide current directory in a multi-threaded program that contains many layers of abstraction)。\n客户端提供多种选项：\n\n句柄将如何使用 (reading, writing and locking；改变 ACL )；只有当客户端具有适当的权限时，才会创建句柄。\n应该传递的事件 （参见 2.5)。\n锁延迟 （参见 2.4)。\n是否应该（或必须）创建新文件或目录。如果创建了一个文件，调用者可以提供初始内容和初始的 ACL 名称。其返回值表明这个文件实际上是否已经创建。\n\nClose() 关闭打开的句柄。不允许进一步使用该句柄。这个调用不会失败。一个相关的调用 Poison() 会导致句柄上的未完成操作和后续操作失败，而不关闭它；这允许客户端取消其他线程发出的 Chubby 调用，而不必担心释放它们访问的内存。\n作用于句柄的主要调用有：\n\nGetContentsAndStat() 返回文件的内容和元数据。文件的内容被原子地、完整地读取。我们避免了部分读和写来阻止大文件。一个相关的调用 GetStat() 只返回元数据，而 ReadDir 返回子目录的名称和元数据。\nSetContents() 写一个文件的内容。可选地，客户端可以提供内容生成编号 (generation number)，以允许客户端模拟文件上的 compare-and-swap；只有在生成编号是当前值时，内容才被改变。文件的内容总是以原子地、完整地写入。一个相关的调用 SetACL() 在节点关联的 ACL 名称执行类似的操作。\nDelete() 如果节点没有孩子删除该节点。\nAcquire()，TryAcquire()， Release() 获取和释放锁。\nGetSequencer() 返回一个序号（参见 2.4)，它描述这个句柄持有的任何锁。\nSetSequalizer() 将一个序号与一个句柄相关联。如果序号不再有效，则句柄上的后续操作将失败。\nCheckSequencer() 检查序号是否有效（参见 2.4)。\n\n如果在创建句柄之后删除了节点，即使随后重新创建了文件，调用也会失败。也就是说，句柄与文件实例相关联，而不是与文件名相关联。Chubby 可能在任意的调用上使用访问控制，但总是检查 Open() 调用（参见 2.3)。\n除了调用本身所需的任何其他参数外，上面的所有调用都使用一个操作参数。这个操作参数保存可能与任何调用相关联的数据和控制信息。特别是通过操作参数，客户可以：\n\n提供一个回调，使调用异步，\n等待此类呼叫的完成，和/或\n获取扩展的错误和诊断信息。\n\n客户端可以使用此 API 执行以下 Primary 选举：所有潜在的 Primary 选举都打开锁文件并尝试获取锁。其中一个成功并成为 Primary ，而其他的作为复制品。Primary 使用 SetContents() 将其标识写入锁文件，以便客户端和副本能够找到它，这些副本使用 GetContentsAndStat() 读取文件，可能是响应文件修改事件。理想情况下，Primary 通过 GetSequencer() 取得一个序号，然后将其传递给与之通信的服务器；它们应该用 CheckSequencer() 确认它仍然是 Primary。锁延迟可用于无法检查序号的服务。\n2.7 Cache\n为了减少读流量，Chubby 客户端将文件数据和节点元数据（包括文件缺失）缓存在内存中的一个一致的写缓存中。缓存由下面描述的租约机制维护，并通过 Master 发送的失效操作维护一致性，Master 保存每个客户端可能缓存的数据的列表。该协议确保客户端要么看到一致的 Chubby 状态，要么看到错误。\n当要更改文件数据或元数据时，修改将被阻塞，而 Master 将数据的失效通知发送给可能已缓存数据的每个客户端；这个机制位于 KeepAlive RPC 之上，下一节将对此进行更详细的讨论。在收到无效通知时，客户端刷新无效状态并通过发出下一个 KeepAlive 调用进行确认。只有在服务器知道每个客户端都将这些缓存失效之后，修改才会继续进行，这可能是因为客户端确认了失效，也可能是因为客户端允许其缓存租约过期。\n只需要进行一轮失效操作，因为 Master 在缓存过期信号没有确认期间将这个节点视为不可缓存的。这种方法允许读取总是被无延迟地处理；这很有用，因为读的数量远远超过写的数量。另一种方法是在失效期间阻止访问节点的调用；这将减少过度渴望的客户端在失效期间用未完成的访问轰炸 Master 的可能性，代价是偶尔的延迟。如果这是一个问题，人们可能会想采用一种混合方案，在检测到过载时切换处理策略。\n缓存协议很简单：它在更改时使缓存的数据失效，并且永远不会更新它。它只是简单的更新而不是失效，但是只更新的协议可能会无理由地低效；访问文件的客户端可能会无限期地接收更新，从而导致大量不必要的更新。\n尽管提供严格一致性的开销很大，我们还是拒绝了较弱的模型，因为我们觉得程序员会发现它们更难使用。类似地，像虚拟同步 (virtual synchrony) 这种要求客户端在所有的消息中交换序号的机制，在一个有多种已经存在的通信协议的环境中也被认为是不合适的。\n除了缓存数据和元数据之外，Chubby 客户端还缓存打开的句柄。因此，如果客户端打开了它之前打开的文件，那么只有第一个 Open() 调用必然会导致 RPC 到达主机。这种缓存在一些次要的方面受到限制，因此它不会影响客户端观察到的语义：临时文件上的句柄在被应用程序关闭后，不能再保留在打开状态；而容许锁定的句柄则可被重用，但是不能由多个应用程序句柄并发使用。最后的这个限制是因为客户端可能利用 Close() 或者 Poison() 的边际效应：取消正在进行的向 Master 请求的 Accquire() 调用。\nChubby 的协议允许客户端缓存锁——也就是说，持有锁的时间比严格要求的长，希望它们可以被同一个客户端再次使用。如果另一个客户端请求了一个冲突锁，则事件通知锁持有者，这允许锁持有者只在别的地方需要这个锁时才释放锁。\n2.8 Sessions and KeepAlives\nChubby 会话是 Chubby cell 和 Chubby 的客户端之间的一种关系；它存在一段时间，由定期的握手来维持，这种握手被称为 KeepAlive。除非 Chubby 客户端通知 Master ，否则客户端的句柄、锁和缓存的数据都是有效的，前提是它的会话仍然有效。（然而，会话维持的协议可能要求客户端确认一个缓存过期信号以维持它的会话，请看下文）。\n一个客户端在第一次联系一个 Chubby cell 的 Master 时请求一个新的会话。它显式地结束会话，或者在它终止时，或者在会话处于空闲状态时（一分钟内没有打开句柄和调用）。\n每个会话都有一个相关的租期——一段延伸到将来的时间，在此期间， Master 保证不会单方面终止会话。间隔的结束被称作租期到期时间 (lease timeout)。 Master 可以自由地向未来延长租期到期时间，但可能不会在时间上往回移动。\n在三种情形下， Master 延长租期到期时间：在创建会话时、 Master 故障恢复时（见下面）以及响应来自客户端的 KeepAlive RPC 时。在接收到 KeepAlive 时， Master 通常会阻塞这个 RPC（不允许它返回），直到客户端之前的租期接近到期。 Master 稍后允许 RPC 返回客户端，并将新的租约超时通知客户端。 Master 可以将超时时间延长任意数量。默认的延伸是 12s，但是一个过载的 Master 可能使用更高的值来减少它必须处理的 KeepAlive 调用的数量。在收到之前的回复后，客户端立即启动一个新的 KeepAlive。这样，客户端确保在 Master 上几乎总是阻塞一个 KeepAlive 调用。\n除了扩展客户端的租期外，KeepAlive 的回复还用于将事件和缓存失效发送回客户端。 Master 允许一个 KeepAlive 在有事件或者缓存过期需要递送时提前返回。在 KeepAlive 应答上搭载事件可以确保客户端在不确认缓存失效的情况下无法维护会话，并导致所有 Chubby 的 RPC 从客户端流向 Master 。这样既简化了客户端，也使得协议可以通过只允许单向发起连接的防火墙。\n客户端维护一个本地租约超时，这是 Master 租约超时的保守的近似值。它跟 Master 的租期过期不一样，是因为客户端必须在两方面做保守的假设。一是 KeepAlive 花在传输上的时间，一是 Master 的时钟超前的度；为了保持一致性，我们要求服务器的时钟频率相对于客户端的时钟频率，不会快于某个常数量。\n如果客户端的本地租约超时过期，它将不确定 Master 是否已终止了它的会话。客户端清空并禁用其缓存，我们称它的会话处于危险之中。客户端等待一个称为宽限期的间隔，默认为 45 秒。如果客户端和 Master 在客户端的宽限期结束之前成功 KeepAlive，则客户端将再次启用其缓存。否则，客户端假定会话已经过期。这样做是为了使 Chubby API 调用不会在一个 Chubby cell 变得不可访问时无限期阻塞；如果在通讯重新建立之前宽限期结束了，调用返回一个错误。\n当宽限期开始时，Chubby 库可以通过危险事件通知应用程序。当会话在通信问题中幸存下来时，安全事件告诉客户端继续；如果会话超时，则发送一个过期事件。此信息允许应用程序在不确定其会话状态时暂停自身，并在问题被证明是暂时的情况下无需重新启动即可恢复。在启动开销很高的服务中，这在避免服务不可用方面可能是很重要的。\n如果客户端持有节点上的句柄 H，而 H 上的任何操作由于关联的会话过期而失败，则 H 上的所有后续操作 ( Close() 和 Poison() 除外 ) 都将以相同的方式失败。客户端可以使用它来保证网络和服务器不可用时只导致操作序列的一个后缀丢失，而不是一个任意的子序列，从而允许使用最终写入将复杂的更改标记为已提交。\n2.9 Fail-overs\n当 Master 失败或丢失 Master 身份时，它将丢弃关于会话、句柄和锁的内存状态。会话租约的权威计时器在 Master 上运行，因此，在选出新的 Master 之前，会话租约计时器将停止；这是合法的，因为它相当于延长客户的租约。如果 Master 选举发生得很快，客户端可以在本地（近似）租约到期之前联系新 Master 。如果选举需要很长时间，客户端就会清空他们的缓存，等待宽限期 (grace period)，同时试图找到新的 Master 。因此，宽限期允许在超过正常租约超时的故障恢复间维护会话。\n\n上图显示了一个漫长的故障恢复事件中的事件序列，在这个事件中，客户端必须使用其宽限期来保存其会话。时间从左到右递增，但时间不是按比例递增的。客户端会话租约以粗箭头显示，新旧 Master （上面的 M1-3) 和客户端（下面的 C13) 都是这样看的。向上的箭头表示 KeepAlive 请求，向下的箭头表示应答。原始的 Master 为客户端提供了会话租赁 M1，而客户端则有一个保守的近似 C1。 Master 承诺在通过 KeepAlive reply 2 通知客户前租赁 M2；客户端能够扩展其对租约 C2 的视图。原 Master 在应答下一个 KeepAlive 之前死掉了，过了一段时间后另一个 Master 被选出。最终客户端的近似租约 (C2) 到期。然后客户端刷新它的缓存并为宽限期启动一个计时器。\n在此期间，客户端无法确定其租约在 Master 处是否已经到期。它不会破坏它的会话，但它会阻止所有应用程序对其 API 的调用，以防止应用程序观察到不一致的数据。在宽限期开始时，Chubby 库向应用程序发送一个危险事件，允许它暂停自己，直到确定其会话的状态。\n最终，新的 Master 选举成功了。 Master 最初使用的是一个保守的近似 M3 的会话租约，它的前身可能已经为客户端提供了这个租约。从客户端到新 Master 的第一个 KeepAlive 请求 (4) 被拒绝，因为它的 Master 代数不正确（下面详细描述）。重试请求 (6) 成功，但通常不会进一步扩展主租约，因为 M3 是保守的。但是，应答 (7) 允许客户端再次延长其租约 (C3)，并可选地通知应用程序其会话不再处于危险中。因为宽限期足够长，可以覆盖租赁 C2 结束到租赁 C3 开始的这段时间，客户端看到的只是延迟。如果宽限期小于这个间隔，客户端将放弃会话并向应用程序报告失败。\n一旦客户端联系了新 Master ，客户端库和 Master 就会合作向应用程序提供没有发生故障的假象。为了实现这一点，新 Master 必须重构前一个 Master 在内存中的状态的保守近似值 (conservative approximation)。这部分是通过读取磁盘上稳定存储的数据（通过普通的数据库复制协议进行复制），部分是通过从客户端获取状态，部分是通过保守的假设 (conservative assumptions) 实现的。数据库记录每个会话、持有的锁和临时文件。\n新选出的 Master 过程如下：\n\n它首先选择一个新的代编号（epoch number），客户端需要在每次调用时显示它。 Master 拒绝使用旧的 epoch number 的客户端调用，并提供新的 epoch number。这可以确保新 ster 不会响应发送给前一个 Master 的旧包，即使是在同一台机器上运行的包。\n新 Master 可以响应 Master 位置请求，但不首先处理与会话相关的传入操作。\n它为记录在数据库中的会话和锁构建内存中的数据结构。会话租期被扩展到前一个 Master 可能使用的最大限度。\nMaster 现在允许客户端执行 KeepAlives，但不允许执行其他与会话相关的操作。\n它向每个会话发出故障恢复事件；这将导致客户端刷新它们的缓存（因为它们可能错过了失效），并警告应用程序其他事件可能已经丢失。\nMaster 一直等待，直到每个会话确认故障恢复事件或让其会话过期。\nMaster 允许所有操作继续进行。\n如果客户端使用在故障恢复之前创建的句柄（根据句柄中序列号的值确定），则 Master 将在内存中重新创建句柄的表示，并执行调用。如果重新创建的句柄关闭，主句柄将把它记录在内存中，这样就不能在 Master epoch 中重新创建它；这确保延迟的或重复的网络包不会意外地重新创建一个关闭的句柄。一个有问题的客户端能在未来的时间中重建一个已关闭的句柄，但倘若该客户端已经有问题的话，则这样不会有什么危害。\n在一段时间之后（比如一分钟）， Master 删除没有打开的文件句柄的临时文件。在故障恢复后的这段时间内，客户端应该刷新临时文件的句柄。这种机制有一个不幸的后果，如果文件上的最后一个客户端在故障恢复间丢失了会话，临时文件可能不会立即消失。\n\n与系统的其他部分相比，故障恢复代码的执行频率要低得多，因此读者会毫不惊讶地发现，故障恢复代码是有趣 bug 的丰富来源。\n2.10 Database implementation\nChubby 第一版使用带复制的 Berkeley DB 版本作为它的数据库。Berkeley DB 提供了 B-tree，它可以将字节字符串键映射到任意的字节字符串值。我们设置了一个按照路径名称中的节数排序的键比较函数，这样就允许节点用它们的路径名作为键，同时保证兄弟节点在排序顺序中相邻。因为 Chubby 不使用基于路径的权限，所以只需在数据库中进行一次查询，就可以对每个文件进行访问。\nBerkeley DB 使用分布式一致性协议在一组服务器上复制其数据库日志。一旦 Master 租约被添加，这就与 Chubby 的设计相匹配，使得实现变得简单。\n虽然 Berkeley DB 的 B-tree 代码使用广泛且成熟，但是复制代码是最近添加的，并且用户较少。维护者必须优先维护和改进他们的最受欢迎的产品特性。虽然 Berkeley DB 的维护者解决了我们遇到的问题，但是我们觉得使用复制代码会使我们承担更多的风险。因此，我们使用类似于 Birrell 等人的设计的提前写日志和快照来编写一个简单的数据库。与前面一样，数据库日志使用分布式一致性协议在副本之间分布。Chubby 很少使用 Berkeley DB 的特性，所以这次重写使得整个系统变得非常简单；例如，虽然我们需要原子操作，但是我们不需要通用事务。\n2.11 Backup\n每几个小时，Chubby cell 的主节点将快照写到不同大楼的 GFS 文件服务的数据库中。\n2.12 Mirroring\nChubby 允许将文件集合从一个 cell 镜像到另一个 cell。镜像非常快，因为文件很小，而且如果文件被添加、删除或修改，事件机制会立即通知镜像处理相关代码。如果没有网络问题，变化会一秒之内便在世界范围内的很多个镜像中反映出来。如果无法访问镜像，则镜像将保持不变，直到恢复连接为止。然后通过比较校验和来识别更新的文件。\n镜像最常用来将配置文件复制到分布在世界各地的各种计算集群。一个名为 global 的特殊 cell 包含一个子树 /ls/global/master，该子树 /ls/cell/slave 被镜像到其他每个 Chubby 的 cell 中。global cell 是特殊的，因为它的五个副本位于世界上分布广泛的地方，所以它几乎总是可以从从大部分国家/地区访问。\n从 global cell 中镜像出的文件中包括 Chubby 自己的访问控制列表、各种文件（其中 Chubby cell 和其他系统向我们的监控服务显示它们的存在）、允许客户端定位大数据集（如 Bigtable cell）的指针以及其他系统的许多配置文件。\n3. Mechanisms for scaling（略）\n3.1 Proxies\n3.2 Partitioning\n4. Use, surprises and design errors\n4.1 Use and behavior\n4.2 Java Clients\n略\n4.3 Use as a name Service\n尽管 Chubby 被设计为一个锁服务，但我们发现它最流行的用法是作为名称服务器。\n在常规的 Internet 命名系统 (DNS) 中，缓存是基于时间的。DNS 条目有生存时间 (TTL)，如果在此期间没有刷新 DNS 数据，则将丢弃这些数据。通常，选择一个合适的 TTL 值是很简单的，但是如果需要立即替换失败的服务，TTL 会变得很小，以至于使 DNS 服务器超载。\n例如，我们的开发人员经常运行涉及数千个进程的任务，并且每个进程之间相互通信，这导致了二次级的 DNS 查询。我们可能希望使用 60 秒的 TTL；这将允许行为不端的客户端被替换，而不会有过多的延迟，并且在我们的环境中不会被认为是一个不合理的短替换时间。在这种情况下，要维护单个任务的 DNS 缓存（最小为 3000 个客户端），需要每秒 15 万个查询（相比之下，一个 2-CPU 2.6GHz 的 Xeon DNS 服务器每秒可以处理 5 万个请求）。更大的任务产生更恶劣的问题，并且多个任务可能同时执行。在引入 Chubby 之前，我们的 DNS 负载的波动性是 Google 面临的一个严重问题。\n相比之下，Chubby 的缓存使用显示地失效 (invalidations)，因此恒定速率的会话 KeepAlive 请求可以在没有更改的情况下在客户端上无限期地维护任意数量的缓存条目。一个 2-CPU 2.6GHz 的 Xeon Chubby Master 可以处理与它直接通信的 9 万个客户端（没有代理）；这些客户端包括了具有上文描述过的那种通讯模式的庞大任务。在不逐个轮询每个名称的情况下提供快速名称更新的功能非常有吸引力，以至于现在 Google 的大部分系统都由 Chubby 提供名字服务。\n尽管 Chubby 的缓存允许一个单独的 cell 能承受大量的客户端，但负载峰值仍然是一个问题。当我们第一次部署基于 Chubby 的名称服务时，启动一个 3000 个进程任务（从而产生 900 万个请求）可能会让 Chubby Master 崩溃。为了解决这个问题，我们选择将名称条目分组成批，这样一次查询就可以返回并缓存作业中大量相关进程（通常为 100 个）的名称映射。\nChubby 提供的缓存语义要比名字服务需要的缓存语义更加精确；名称解析只需要及时通知，而不需要完全一致。因而，这里有一个时机，可以通过引入特别地为名字查找设计的简单协议转换服务器，来降低 Chubby 的负载。假如我们预见到将 Chubby 用作名字服务的用法，我们可能选择实现完整的代理，而不是提供这种简单但没有必要的额外的服务器。\n还有一个协议转换服务器：Chubby 的 DNS 服务器。这使得存储在 Chubby 中的命名数据对 DNS 客户端可用。这种服务器很重要，它既能减少了 DNS 名字到 Chubby 名字之间的转换，也能适应已经存在的不能轻易转换的应用程序，例如浏览器。\n4.4 Problems with fail-over\n4.5 Abusive clients\n4.6 lessons learned（经验教训）\n在这里，我们列出了经验教训，以及如果有机会，我们可能会做的各种设计更改：\n开发者极少考虑可用性。 我们发现开发者极少考虑失败的可能性，并倾向于认为像 Chubby 这样的服务好像总是可用的。例如，我们的开发人员曾经构建了一个系统，该系统使用了数百台机器，在 Chubby 选出新 Master 时，启动恢复过程需要几十分钟。这将单个故障的后果在时间和受影响的机器数量上都放大了 100 倍。我们希望开发人员为短时间的中断做好计划，以便这样的事件对他们的应用程序影响很小或没有影响。这是第 2.1 节讨论的粗粒度锁的参数之一。\n开发人员也没有意识到服务启动与应用程序可用之间的区别。例如，global Chubby cell 几乎总是处于上升状态，因为同时处于下降状态的数据中心很少超过两个。但是，对于给定的客户端，其观察到的可用性通常低于客户端的局部 Chubby cell 的观察到的可用性。首先，本地 cell 不太可能与客户端分区，其次，虽然本地 cell 可能经常由于维护而停机，但是相同的维护直接影响客户端，所以客户端不会观察到 Chubby 的不可用性。\n我们的 API 选择也会影响开发人员处理 Chubby 停机的方式。例如，Chubby 提供了一个事件，允许客户端检测 Master 故障恢复何时发生。目的是让客户端检查可能的更改，因为其他事件可能已经丢失。不幸的是，许多开发人员选择在收到这个事件时关闭他们的应用程序，从而大大降低了系统的可用性。我们可以更好地发送冗余的\"文件更改\"事件，甚至确保在故障恢复间没有丢失事件。\n目前，我们使用三种机制来防止开发人员对 Chubby 的可用性过于乐观，特别是 global cell 的可用性。首先，正如前面提到的，我们审查了项目团队计划如何使用 Chubby ，并建议他们不要使用那些将其可用性与 Chubby 紧密联系在一起的技术。\n其次，我们现在提供执行一些高级任务的库，这样开发人员就可以自动地从中断中隔离出来。第三，我们使用每次 Chubby 停机的事后分析作为一种方法，不仅可以消除 Chubby 和我们的操作过程中的 bug，而且还可以降低应用程序对 Chubby 可用性的敏感性——这两种方法都可以提高系统的整体可用性。\n可以忽略细粒度锁定的内容在 2.1 节的末尾，我们概述了一个服务器的设计，客户端可以运行该服务器来提供细粒度锁定。到目前为止，我们还不需要编写这样的服务器，这可能令人感到惊讶；我们的开发人员通常发现，为了优化他们的应用程序，他们必须删除不必要的通信，这通常意味着找到一种使用粗粒度锁定的方法。\n糟糕的 API 选择通常会带来意想不到的影响，我们的 API 发展得很好，但有一个错误很明显。我们取消长时间运行的调用的方法是 Close() 和 Poison() RPC，它们也会丢弃句柄的服务器状态。这可以防止获取锁的句柄被共享，例如被多个线程共享。我们可以添加一个 Cancel() RPC 来允许更多地共享打开的句柄。\nRPC 的使用影响传输协议 KeepAlives 被用于刷新客户端的会话租约，也用于将事件和缓存失效从 Master 传递给客户端。这个设计有自动的符合预期的效应：一个客户端不能在没有应答缓存过期的情况下刷新会话状态。\n这似乎很理想，除了这样会在传输协议的选择中引入紧张情形以外。TCP 的拥塞时回退 (back off) 策略不关心更高层的超时，例如 Chubby 的租期，因此基于 TCP 的 KeepAlive 在发生高网络拥塞时导致许多丢失的会话。我们被迫通过 UDP 而不是 TCP 发送 KeepAlive RPC；UDP 没有拥塞避免机制，因此我们只有当高层的时间界限必须满足时才使用 UDP 协议。\n我们可以使用一个附加的基于 TCP 的 GetEvent() RPC 来扩展协议，它将用于在正常情况下通信事件和失效，使用的方式与 KeepAlives 相同。KeepAlive 回复仍然包含未确认事件的列表，因而事件最终都将被应答。\n5. Comparision with related work\nChubby 基于很多优秀的 idea，cache 设计受到分布式文件系统的启发。session 和 cache 的 token 类似于 Echo 系统中的行为；session 减少了租约的开销。提供一个通用的 lock services 可以在 VMS 期刊 中被发现。像 cache 模型，Chubby 的 API 基于文件系统模型，包括文件系统类似的名字空间的 idea\nChubby 与 Echo 或 AFS 等分布式文件系统在性能和存储方面有所不同：客户端不会读取、写入或存储大量数据，除非数据被缓存，否则它们不会期望高吞吐量甚至低延迟。他们确实期望一致性、可用性和可靠性，但是当性能不那么重要时，这些属性更容易实现。因为 Chubby 的数据库很小，我们可以在线存储它的许多副本（通常是五个副本和少数备份）。我们每天进行多次完全备份，通过数据库状态的校验和，我们每隔几个小时就相互比较副本。正常的文件系统性能和存储需求的弱化使我们能够用一个 Chubby  Master 为成千上万的客户端提供服务。我们通过提供一个中心点，许多客户端在这个中心点共享信息和协同活动，解决了一类我们的系统开发人员面对的问题。\n各种文献描述了大量的文件系统和锁服务器，所以不可能做一个彻底的比较。所以我们提供细节：我们选择与 Boxwood 的锁服务器比较，因为它是最近设计的，它也旨在在松耦合的环境中运行，但其设计在很多方面不同于 Chubby，一些设计是有趣的，一些设计是因为系统的差异所决定的。\nChubby 在单个服务中实现锁、可靠的小文件存储系统以及会话/租赁机制。相反，Boxwood 将它们分为三个：锁服务、Paxos 服务（状态的可靠存储库）和故障检测服务。Boxwood 系统本身使用这三个组件，但另一个系统可以独立使用这些构件。我们怀疑这种设计上的差异源于目标受众的不同。Chubby 的目标受众和应用程序是多样化的；它的用户范围从创建新分布式系统的专家到编写管理脚本的新手。对于我们的环境，使用熟悉的 API 的大型共享服务似乎很有吸引力。相比之下，Boxwood 提供了一个工具包（至少在我们看来是这样），它适用于少数更成熟的开发人员，他们从事的项目可能共享代码，但不需要一起使用。\n在许多情况下，Chubby 提供了比 Boxwood 更高级别的接口。例如，Chubby 组合了锁和文件名空间，而 Boxwood 的锁名称是简单的字节序列。Chubby 客户端默认缓存文件状态；Boxwood 的 Paxos 服务的客户端可以通过锁服务实现缓存，但是很可能会使用 Boxwood 本身提供的缓存。\n这两个系统有明显不同的默认参数，为不同的期望而选择：每个客户端每 200 毫秒与每个 Boxwood 故障检测器联系一次，超时为 1； Chubby 的默认租赁时间是 12 秒，每隔 7 秒交换一次 KeepAlives。Boxwood 的子组件使用两个或三个副本来实现可用性，而我们通常每个 cell 使用五个副本。然而，这些选择本身并没有表明深层次的设计差异，而是指出了这些系统中的参数必须如何调整以适应更多的客户端机器，或者机架与其他项目共享的不确定性。\n一个更有趣的区别是引入了 Chubby 的宽限期，这是 Boxwood 所缺乏的。（回忆一下，宽限期允许客户在长时间的 Master 宕机期间不丢失会话或锁。Boxwood 的 \"宽限期\" 相当于 Chubby 的 \"会话租赁\"，是一个不同的概念。) 同样，这种差异是由于对两个系统的规模和失败概率的期望不同造成的。虽然 Master 故障恢复很少见，但是丢失的 Chubby 锁对客户来说代价是很昂贵的。\n最后，这两个系统中的锁用于不同的目的。Chubby 的锁重量更重，需要记序器来保证外部资源的安全，而 Boxwood 锁重量更轻，主要用于 Boxwood 内部。\n6. Summary\nChubby 是一个分布式锁服务，并且可以用做名字服务以及配置服务。\n设计基于一些良好的 idea：共识协议提供了容错能力，一致性客户端 cache 减少了服务负载同时保留了简单的语义，及时的更新通知，熟悉的文件系统接口。我们使用 cacheing， protocol-conversion servers, simple load adaptation 使得一个 Chubby 实例可以服务成千上万 client。并且可以通过 proxies 和 partitioning 扩展。\nChubby 成为 Google 的主要名字服务；是 MapReduce 的约定机制；是 GFS 和 BitTable 的选主组件；是高可用文件的标准组件，例如访问控制。\n","id":"https://wendajiang.github.io/chubby/","title":"The Chubby lock service for loosely-coupled distributed systems"},"https://wendajiang.github.io/coroutine-learn/":{"body":"https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2021/p2464r0.html\n反对 asio 进入标准\nCoroutine Theory\nCoroutines are Functions are Coroutines\nA coroutine is a generalisation of a function that allows the function to be suspended and then later resumed.\n\"Normal\" Functions\nA normal function can be thought of as having two operations: Call and Return(note that I'm lumping \"throwing an exception\" here broadly under the Return operation)\nThe Call operation creates an activation frame, suspends execution of the calling function and transfers execution to the start of the function being called.\nThe Return operation passes the return-value to the caller, destroys the activation frame and then resumes execution of the caller just after the point at which it called the function.\n\nActivation Frames\nThe block of memory that holds the current state of a particular invocation of a function. This state includes the values of any parameters that were passed to it and the values of any local variables.\nFor \"normal\" functions, the activation frame also includes the return-address. You can think of these pieces of information together as describing the 'continuation' of the function-call. ie. they describe which invocation of which function should continue executing at which point when this function completes.\nWith \"normal\" functions, all activation frames have strictly nested lifetimes. This strict nesting allows use of a highly efficient memory allocation data-structure for allocating and freeing the activation frames for each of the function calls. This data-structure is commonly refered to as \"the stack\".\n\nThe 'Call' operation\nWhen a funtion calls another function, the caller must first prepare itself for suspension.\nThe 'Return' operation\nWhen a function returns via return-stmt, the function first stores the return value (if any) where the caller can access it. This could either be in the caller's activation frame or the function's activation frame.\nThen the function destorys the activation frame by:\n\ndestroying any local variables in-scope at the return-point\ndestroying any parameter objects\nfreeing memory used by the activation-frame\n\nAnd finally, it resumes execution of the caller by:\n\nrestoring the activation frame of the caller by setting the stack register to point to the activation frame of the caller and restoring any registers that might have been clobbered by the function.\njumping to the resume-point of the caller that was stored during the 'Call' operation.\n\nCoroutines\nCoroutines generalise the operations of a function by separating out some of the steps performed in the Call and Return operations into three extra operations: Suspend, Resume, Destroy.\nThe Suspend operation suspends execution of the coroutine at the current point within the function and transfers execution back to the caller or resumer without destroying the activation frame. Any Objects in-scope at the point of suspension remain alive after the coroutine execution is suspended.\nNote that, like the Return operation of a function, a coroutine can only be suspended from within the coroutine itself at well-defined suspend-points.(co_await, co_yield)\nThe Resume operation resumes execution of a suspended coroutine at the point at which is was suspended. This reactivates the coroutine's activation frame.\nThe Destroy operation destroys the activation frame without resuming execution of the coroutine. Any objects that were in-scope at the suspend point will be destroyed. Memory used to store the activation frame is freed.\nCoroutine activation frames\nSince coroutines can be suspended without destroying the activation frame, we can no longer guarantee that activation frame frame lifetimes will be stricted nested. This means that activation frames cannot in general be allocated using a stack data-structure and so may need to be stored on the heap instead.\nThere are some provisions in the C++ Coroutines TS to allow the memory for the coroutine frame to be allocated from the activation frame of the caller if the compiler can prove that the lifetime of the coroutine is indeed strictly nested within the lifetime of the caller. This can avoid heap allocations in many case provided you have a sufficiently smart pointer.\nWith coroutins there are some parts of the activation frame that need to be preserved across coroutine suspension and there are some parts that only need to be kept around while the coroutine is executing. For example, the lifetime of a variable with scope that does not span any coroutine suspend-points can potentially be stored on the stack.\nYou can logically think of the activation frame of a corouine as being comprised of two parts: the coroutine fame and the stack frame.\nThe 'coroutine frame' holds part of the coroutine's activation frame that persists while the coroutine if suspended and the 'stack frame' part only exists while the coroutine is executing and is freed when the coroutine suspends and transfers execution back to the caller/resumer.\nreference\n\nhttps://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20210504-01/?p=105178\nhttps://lewissbaker.github.io/\n\n","id":"https://wendajiang.github.io/coroutine-learn/","title":"coroutine learn"},"https://wendajiang.github.io/cpp-exception/":{"body":"introduction\nZero-overhead is not zero cost, Hutter proposal one determintic-exception, but Bjarne Stroutrup is negative about it.\nThe origins of exception handling lie in the problems experienced managing a variety of error-handling approaches, such as C’s errno, error-states, callbacks, return codes, and return objects.

Argument-dependent lookup, also known as ADL, or Koenig lookup, is the set of rules for looking up the unqualified function names in function-call expressions, including implicit function calls to overloaded operators. These function names are looked up in the namespaces of their arguments in addition to the scopes and namespaces considered by the usual unqualified name lookup.\nADL makes it possible to use operators defined in a different namespace. Example:\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;\nint main() {\n  std::cout &lt;&lt; \"Test\\n\"; // There is no operator&lt;&lt; in global namespace, but ADL examines std namespace because the left argument is in std and finds std::operator&lt;&lt;(std::ostream&amp;, const char*)\n  operator&lt;&lt;(std::cout, \"Test\\n\"); // Same, using function call notation.\n\n  std::cout &lt;&lt; endl; // Error: 'endl' is not declared in this namespace. This is not a function call to endl(), so ADL does not apply\n  endl(std::cout); // Ok: This is a function call: ADL examines std namespace because the argument of endl is in std, and finds std::endl\n\n  (endl)(std::cout); // Error: 'endl' is not declared in this namespace. The sub-expression (endl) is not an unqualified-id\n}\n\nAnother example:\nusing std::swap;\nswap(a, b); // not std::swap(a, b); as if this namespace define the swap, first using this namespace swap, not std::swap.\n\nMore detailed rules, please see cpp-reference.\nName lookup\nsrc\nFor example, to compile std::cout &lt;&lt; std::endl;, the compiler performs:\n\nunqualified name lookup for the name std, which finds the declaration of namespace std in the header &lt;iostream&gt;\nqualified name lookup for the name cout, which finds a variable declaration in the namespace std\nqualified name lookup for the name endl, which finds a function template declaration in the namespace std\nboth argument-dependent lookup for the name operator&lt;&lt;, which finds multiple function template declarations in the namespace std, and qualified name lookup for the name std::ostream::operator&lt;&lt;, which find multiple member function declarations in class std::ostream\n\nFor function and function template names, name lookup can associate multiple declarations with the same name, and may obtain additional declarations from ADL. Template argument deduction may also apply, and the set of declarations is passed to overload resolution, which selects the declaration that will be used. Member access rules, if applicable, are considered only after name lookup and overload resolution.\nFor all other names (variables, namespaces, classed, etc), name lookup can associate multiple declarations only if they declare the same entity, otherwise it must produce a single declaration in order for the program to compile. Lookup for a name in a scope finds all declarations of that name, with one exception, known as the \"struct hack\" or \"type/non-type hiding\": Within the same scope, some occurrences of a name may refer to a declaration of a class/struct/union/enum that is not a typedef, while all other occurrences of the same name either all refer to the same variable, non-static data member, or enumerator, or they all refer to possibly overloaded function or function template names. In this case, there is no error, but the type name is hidden from lookup.\nTypes of lookup\nIf the name appears immediately to the right of the scope resolution operator:: or possibly after :: followed by the disambiguating keyword template, see\nQualified name lookup\nA qualified name may refer to a\n\nclass member (include static / non-static functions, types, templates, etc).\nnamespace member (including another namespace)\nenumerator\n\nOtherwise, see\nUnqualified name lookup\n\nwhich, for function names, includes Argument-dependent lookup\n\nCPO\nc++20 ranges library import CPO, using function object not function to inhibit ADL.\nusing std::vector;\nusing namespace std::ranges;\n\nvector&lt;int&gt; a;\nfind(a.begin(), a.end(), 2);\n// should call std::ranges::find\n\n\nvector in namespace std, so ADL would find the std::find\nstd::find need begin/end have the same type, so std::find is more specific to std::ranges::find\nand std::ranges::find has Concepts, but specific is more high priority to the concepts.\n\nIf std::ranges::find is function, above code would call std::find.

简介\n现代数据处理是一个复杂而又令人兴奋的领域。MapReduce和它的衍生系统（如Hadoop, Pig, Hive, Spark等）解决了处理数据的“量”上的问题。流处理SQL上社区也做了很多的工作（如查询系统【1,14,15】，窗口【22】，数据流【24】，时间维度【28】，语义模型【9】）。在低延时处理上 Spark Streaming, MillWheel, Storm等做了很多尝试。数据工作者现在拥有了很多强有力的工具把大规模无序的数据加工成结构化的数据，而结构化的数据拥有远大于原始数据的价值。但是我们仍然认为现存的模型和方法在处理一些常见的场景时有心无力。\n考虑一个例子：一家流媒体平台提供商通过视频广告，向广告商收费把视频内容进行商业变现。收费标准按广告收看次数、时长来计费。这家流媒体的平台支持在线和离线播放。流媒体平台提供商希望知道每天向广告商收费的金额，希望按视频和广告进行汇总统计。另外，他们想在大量的历史离线数据上进行历史数据分析，进行各种实验。\n广告商和内容提供者想知道视频被观看了多少次，观看了多长时间，视频被播放时投放了哪个广告，或者广告播放是投放在哪个视频内容中，观看的人群统计分布是什么。广告商也很想知道需要付多少钱，而内容提供者想知道赚到了多少钱。 而他们需要尽快得到这些信息，以便调整预算/调整报价，改变受众，修正促销方案，调整未来方向。所有这些越实时越好，因涉及到金额，准确性是至关重要的。\n尽管数据处理系统天生就是复杂的，视频平台还是希望一个简单而灵活的编程模型。最后，由于他们基于互联网的业务遍布全球，他们需要的系统要能够处理分散在全球的数据。\n上述场景需要计算的指标包括每个视频观看的时间和时长，观看者、视频内容和广告是如何组合的（即按用户，按视频的观看“会话”）。概念上这些指标都非常直观，但是现有的模型和系统并无法完美地满足上述的技术要求。\n批处理系统如MapReduce (包括Hadoop的变种，如Pig，Hive)，FlumeJava, Spark等无法满足时延的要求，因为批处理系统需要等待收集所有的数据成一个批次后才开始处理。对有些流处理系统来说，目前不了解它们在大规模使用的情况下是否还能保持容错性（如(Aurora [1], TelegraphCQ [14], Niagara [15], Esper[17]），而那些提供了可扩展性和容错性的系统则缺乏准确性或语义的表达性。很多系统缺乏“恰好处理一次”的语义（如Storm, Samza, Pulsar）影响了数据的准确性。或者提供了窗口但语义局限于基于记录数或基于数据处理时间的窗口（Spark Streamming, Sonora, Trident）。而大多数提供了基于事件发生时间窗口的，或者依赖于消息必须有序（SQLStream）或者缺乏按事件发生时间触发窗口计算的语义（Stratosphere/Flink）。CEDR和Trill可能值得一提，它们不仅提供了有用的标记触发语义，而且提供了一种增量模型，这一点上和我们这篇论文一致，但它们的窗口语义无法有效地表达基于会话的窗口。它们基于标记的触发语义也无法有效处理3.3节中的某些场景。MillWheel和Spark Streaming的可扩展性良好，容错性不错，低延时，是一种合理的方案，但是对于会话窗口缺乏一种直观的高层编程模型。我们发现只有Pulsar系统对非对齐窗口（译者注：指只有部分记录进入某一特定窗口，会话窗口就是一种非对齐窗口）提供了高层次语义抽象，但是它缺乏对数据准确性的保证。Lambda架构能够达到上述的大部分要求，但是系统体系太过复杂，必须构建和维护两套系统（译者注：指离线和在线系统）。Summingbird改善了Lambda体系的复杂性，提供了针对批处理和流处理系统的一个统一封装抽象，但是这种抽象限制了能支持的计算的种类，并且仍然需要维护两套系统，运维复杂性仍然存在。\n上述的问题并非无药可救，这些系统在活跃的发展中终究会解决这些问题。但是我们认为所有这些模型和系统（除了CEDR和Trill）存在一个比较大的问题。这个问题是他们假设输入数据（不管是无边界或者有边界的）在某个时间点后会变完整。我们认为这种假设是有根本性的问题。我们面临的一方面是庞大无序的数据，另一方面是数据消费者复杂的语义和时间线上的各种需求。对于当下如此多样化和多变的数据使用用例（更别说那些浮现在地平线上的 译者注：应该是指新的，AI时代的到来带来的对数据使用的新玩法），我们认为任何一种有广泛实用价值的方法必须提供简单，强有力的工具，可以为手上某个具体的使用案例平衡数据的准确性、延迟程度和处理成本（译者注：意指对某些用例可能需要低延迟更多，某些用例需要准确性更多。而一个好的工具需要能够动态根据用户的使用场景、配置进行适应，具体的技术细节由工具本身消化）。最后，我们认为需要摆脱目前一个主流的观点，认为执行引擎负责描述系统的语义。合理设计和构建的批，微批次，流处理系统能够保证同样程度的准确性。而这三种系统在处理无边界数据流时都非常常见。如果我们抽象出一个具有足够普遍性，灵活性的模型，那么执行引擎的选择就只是延迟程度和处理成本之间的选择。\n从这个方面来说，这篇论文的概念性贡献在于提出了一个统一的模型能够：\n\n\n对无边界，无序的数据源，允许按数据本身的特征进行窗口计算，得到基于事件发生时间的有序结果，并能在准确性、延迟程度和处理成本之间调整。\n\n\n解构数据处理管道的四个相关维度，使得它们透明地，灵活地进行组合。\n\n计算什么结果\n按事件发生时间计算\n在流计算处理时间时被真正触发计算\n早期的计算结果如何在后期被修正\n\n\n\n分离数据处理的计算逻辑表示和对逻辑的物理实现，使得对批处理，微批处理，流计算引擎的选择成为简单的对准确性、延迟程度和处理成本之间的选择。\n\n\n具体来说，上述的贡献包含：\n\n一个支持非对齐事件发生时间窗口的模型，一组简单的窗口创建和使用的API。（参考2.2）\n一个根据数据处理管道特征来决定计算结果输出次数的触发模型。一组强有力而灵活的描述触发语义的声明式API。\n能把数据的更新和撤回和上述窗口、触发模型集成的增量处理模型。（2.3）\n基于MillWheel流处理引擎和FlumeJava批处理引擎的可扩展实现。为Google Cloud Dataflow重写了外部实现，并提供了一个开源的运行引擎不特定的SDK。（3.1）\n指导模型设计的一组核心设计原则。\nGoogle在处理大规模无边界乱序数据流的处理经验，这也是驱动我们开发这套模型的原因。\n\n最后，不足为奇地，这个模型没有任何魔术效果。那些现有的强一致性批处理系统，微批处理系统，流处理系统，Lambda系统所无法计算的东西仍然无法解决。CPU,RAM Disk的内在约束依然存在。我们所提供的是一个能够简单地定义表达并行计算的通用框架。这种表达的方式和底层的执行引擎无关，同时针对任何特定的问题域，提供了根据手上数据和资源的情况来精确地调整延时程度和准确性的能力。从这一点上来说，这个模型的目标是简化大规模数据处理管道的构建。\n1.1 无边界、有边界与流处理、批处理\n（本论文中）当描述无限/有限数据集时，我们更愿意使用有边界/无边界这组词汇，而不是流/批。因为流/批可能意味着使用某种特定的执行引擎。在现实中，无边界数据集可以用批处理系统反复调度来处理，而良好设计的流处理系统也可以完美地处理有边界数据集。从这个模型的角度来看，区分流/批的意义是不大的，因此我们保留这组词汇（流、批）用来专指执行引擎。\n1.2 窗口\n窗口操作把一个数据集切分为有限的数据片以便于聚合处理。当面对无边界的数据时，有些操作需要窗口（以定义大多数聚合操作需要的边界：汇总，外链接，以时间区域定义的操作；如最近5分钟xx等）。另一些则不需要（如过滤，映射，内链接等）。对有边界的数据，窗口是可选的，不过很多情况下仍然是一种有效的语义概念（如回填一大批的更新数据到之前读取无边界数据源处理过的数据 译者注：类似于Lambda架构）。窗口基本上都是基于时间的；不过也有些系统支持基于记录数的窗口。这种窗口可以认为是基于一个逻辑上的时间域，该时间域中的元素包含顺序递增的逻辑时间戳。窗口可以是对齐的，也就是说窗口应用于所有落在窗口时间范围内的数据。也可以是非对齐的，也就是应用于部分特定的数据子集（如按某个键值筛选的数据子集）。图一列出了处理无边界数据时常见的三种窗口。\n\n固定窗口（有时叫翻滚窗口）是按固定窗口大小定义的，比如说小时窗口或天窗口。它们一般是对齐窗口，也就是说，每个窗口都包含了对应时间段范围内的所有数据。有时为了把窗口计算的负荷均匀分摊到整个时间范围内，有时固定窗口会做成把窗口的边界的时间加上一个随机数，这样的固定窗口则变成了不对齐窗口。\n滑动窗口按窗口大小和滑动周期大小来定义，比如说小时窗口，每一分钟滑动一次。这个滑动周期一般比窗口大小小，也就是说窗口有相互重合之处。滑动窗口一般也是对齐的；尽管上面的图为了画出滑动的效果窗口没有遮盖到所有的键，但其实五个滑动窗口其实是包含了所有的3个键，而不仅仅是窗口3包含了所有的3个键。固定窗口可以看做是滑动窗口的一个特例，即窗口大小和滑动周期大小相等。\n会话是在数据的子集上捕捉一段时间内的活动。一般来说会话按超时时间来定义，任何发生在超时时间以内的事件认为属于同一个会话。会话是非对齐窗口。如上图，窗口2只包含key 1，窗口3则只包含key2。而窗口1 和 4 都包含了key 3。（译者注：假设key 是用户id， 那么两次活动之间间隔超过了超时时间，因此系统需要重新定义一个会话窗口。）\n1.3 时间域\n当处理包含事件发生时间的数据时，有两个时间域需要考虑。尽管已经有很多文献提到（特别是时间管理【28】，语义模型【9】，窗口【22】，乱序处理【23】，标记【30】，心跳【21】，水位线【2】，帧【31】），这里仍然重复一下，因为这个概念清晰之后2.3节会更易于理解。这两个时间域是：\n\n事件时间，即当该事件发生时，该事件所在的系统记录下来的系统时间。\n处理时间，即在数据处理管道中处理数据时，一个事件被数据处理系统观察到的时间，是数据处理系统的时间。注意我们这里不假设在分布式系统中时钟是同步的。\n\n一个事件的事件发生时间是永远不变的，但是一个事件的处理时间随着它在数据管道中一步步被处理时持续变化的。这个区别是非常重要的，特别是我们需要根据事件的发生时间进行分析的时候。\n在数据处理过程中，由于系统本身的一些现实影响（通信延迟，调度算法，处理时长，管道中间数据序列化等）会导致这两个时间存在差值且动态波动（见图2）。使用记录全局数据处理进度的标记、或水位线，是一种很好的方式来可视化这个差值。在本论文中，我们采用一种类似MillWheel的水位线，它是一个时间戳，代表小于这个时间戳的数据已经完全被系统处理了（通常用启发式方法建立）。\n对大多数现实世界中分布式数据集，系统缺乏足够的信息来建立一个100%准确的水位线。举例来说，在视频观看“会话”的例子中，考虑离线观看。如果有人把他们的移动设备带到野外，系统根本没有办法知道他们何时会回到有网络连接的地带，然后开始上传他们在没有网络连接时观看视频的数据。因此，大多数的水位定义是基于有限的信息启发式地定义。对于带有未处理数据的元数据的结构化输入源，比如说日志文件（译者注：可能应该不是泛指一般的日志文件），水位线的猜测明显要准确些，因此大多数情况下可以作为一个处理完成的估计。另外，很重要的一点，一旦水位线建立之后，它可以被传递到数据处理管道的下游（就像标记（Punctuation）那样 译者注：类似于Flink的checkpoint barrier）。当然下游要明确知道这个水位线仍然是一个猜测。\n我们之前曾经说过，数据已经被完全处理的标记经常和数据的准确性是相互冲突的，因此，我们不会太过于依赖于水位线。不过，它确实是一种有用的手段。系统可以用它猜测所有事件发生时间早于水位线的数据已经完全被观察到。应用可以用它来可视化处理时间差，也用它来监控系统总体的健康状况和总体处理进展，也可以用它里做一些不影响数据准确性的决策，比如基本垃圾回收策略等。\n\n在理想的情况下，两个时间的差值应该永远为零；事件一旦发生，我们就马上处理掉。现实则更像图2那样。从12点开始，由于数据处理管道的延迟，水位线开始偏离真实时间，12:02时则靠近回来，而12:03的时候延迟变得更大。在分布式数据处理系统里，这种偏差波动非常普遍，在考虑数据处理系统如何提供一个正确的，可重复的结果时，把这种情况纳入考虑很关键。\n2. Dataflow 模型\n在这一个小节中，我们将定义正式的系统模型。我们还会解释为什么它的语义足够泛化，能涵盖标准的批处理，微批次处理，流处理，以及混合了流批语义的Lambda架构。代码示例是基于Dataflow的Java SDK的一个简化版本，是从FlumeJava API演化而来。\n2.1 核心编程模型\n我们先从经典的批处理模型开始来考虑我们的核心编程模型。Dataflow SDK把所有的数据抽象为键值对，对键值对有两个核心的数据转换操作：\n\nParDo 用来进行通用的并行化处理。每个输入元素（这个元素本身有可能是一个有限的集合）都会使用一个UDF进行处理（在Dataflow中叫做DoFn），输出是0或多个输出元素。这个例子是把键的前缀进行展开，然后把值复制到展开后的键构成新的键值对并输出。\n\n\n\nGroupByKey 用来按键值把元素重新分组\n\n\nParDo 操作因为是对每个输入的元素进行处理，因此很自然地就可以适用于无边界的数据。而 GroupByKey 操作，在把数据发送到下游进行汇总前，需要收集到指定的键对应的所有数据。如果输入源是无边界的，那么我们不知道何时才能收集到所有的数据。所以通常的解决方案是对数据使用窗口操作。\n2.2 窗口\n支持聚合操作的系统经常把GroupByKey操作重新定义成为GroupByKeyAndWindow 操作。我们在这一点上的主要贡献是支持非对齐窗口。这个贡献包含两个关键性的洞见：第一是从模型简化的角度上，把所有的窗口策略都当做非对齐窗口，而底层实现来负责把对齐窗口作为一个特例进行优化。 第二点是窗口操作可以被分隔为两个互相相关的操作：\n\nset AssignWindows(T datum) 即窗口分配操作。这个操作把元素分配到0或多个窗口中去。这个也就是Li在[22]中提到的桶操作符。\nset MergeWindows(Set windows) 即窗口合并操作，这个操作在汇总时合并窗口。这使得数据驱动的窗口在随着数据到达的过程中逐渐建立起来并进行汇总操作。\n\n对于任何一种窗口策略，这两种操作都是密切相关的。滑动窗口分配需要滑动窗口合并，而会话窗口分配需要会话窗口合并。\n注意，为了原生地支持事件发生时间窗口，我们现在定义系统中传递的数据不再仅仅是键值对 (key, value)， 而是一个四元组 (key, value, event_time, window)。数据进入系统时需要自带事件发生时间戳（后期在管道处理过程中也可以修改），然后初始化分配一个默认的覆盖所有事件发生时间的全局窗口。而全局窗口语义默认等同于标准的批处理模型。\n2.2.1 窗口分配\n从模型角度来说，把一条数据分配给某几个窗口意味着把这条数据复制给了这些窗口。以图3为例，它是把两条记录分配给一个2分钟宽，每一分钟滑动一次的窗口。（简单起见，时间戳用HH:MM的格式给出）\n在这个例子中，两条数据在两个窗口中冗余存在，因而最后变成了四条记录。另外注意一点，窗口是直接关联到数据元素本身的，因此，窗口的分配可以在处理管道的聚合发生前的任何一处进行。这一点很重要，因为聚合操作有可能是下游复杂组合数据转换的一个子操作。（如Sum.integersPerKey 译者注：下文会提到，这个转换是指键值对中的值为整形，把整形值按键进行求和）\n\n2.2.2 窗口合并\n窗口合并作为GroupByKeyAndWindow的一部分出现，要解释清楚的话，我们最好拿例子来阐述。我们拿会话窗口来作为例子，因为会话窗口正是我们想要解决的用例之一。图4展示了例子数据4条，3条包含的键是k1，一条是k2，窗口按会话窗口组织，会话的过期时间是30分钟。所有4条记录初始时都属于缺省的全局窗口。AssignWindows的会话窗口实现把每个元素都放入一个30分钟长的单个窗口，这个窗口的时间段如果和另外一个窗口的时间段相互重合，则意味着这两个窗口应该属于同一个会话。AssignWindows后是GroupByKeyAndWindow的操作，这个操作其实由五个部分组成：\n\nDropTimestamps – 删除数据上的时间戳，因为窗口合并后，后续的计算只关心窗口。\nGroupByKey – 把（值，窗口）二元组按键进行分组\nMergeWindows – 窗口合并。把同一个键的（值，窗口）进行窗口合并。具体的合并方式取决于窗口策略。在这个例子中，窗口v1和v4重叠，因此会话窗口策略把这两个窗口合并为一个新的，更长的会话窗口。（如粗体所示）\nGroupAlsoByWindow – 对每个键，把值按合并后的窗口进行进一步分组。在本例中，由于v1和v4已经合并进了同一个窗口，因此这一步里面v1和v4被分到了同一组。\nExpandToElements – 把已经按键，按窗口分好组的元素扩展成(键，值，事件发生时间，窗口)四元组。这里的时间戳是新的按窗口的时间戳。在这个例子里我们取窗口的结束时间作为这条记录的时间戳，但任何大于或等于窗口中最老的那条记录的时间戳都认为是符合水位线正确性的。\n\n\n2.2.3 API\n下面我们使用Cloud Dataflow SDK来展示使用窗口操作的例子，现对同一个键的整型数值求和。\nPCollection&lt;KV&lt;String, Integer&gt;&gt; input = IO.read(...);\nPCollection&lt;KV&lt;String, Integer&gt;&gt; output = input.apply(Sum.integersPerKey());\n\n假如说要对30分钟长的会话窗口进行同样的计算，那么只要在求和前增加一个 window.into 调用就可以了：\nPCollection&lt;KV&lt;String, Integer&gt;&gt; input = IO.read(...);\nPCollection&lt;KV&lt;String, Integer&gt;&gt; output = input\n.apply(Window.into(Sessions.withGapDuration( Duration.standardMinutes(30))))\n  .apply(Sum.integersPerKey());\n\n2.3 触发器和增量处理\n构建非对齐的事件发生时间窗口是一个进步，不过我们还有两个问题需要解决。\n\n我们需要提供基于记录和基于处理时间的窗口。否则我们会和现有的其他系统的窗口语义不兼容\n我们需要知道何时把窗口计算结果发往下游。由于数据事件发生时间的无序性，我们需要某种其他的信号机制来明确窗口已经完结（译者注：就是说，窗口所应该包含的数据已经完全到达并且被窗口观察到，包含到）。\n\n关于第一点，基于记录数和基于处理时间的窗口，我们会在2.4里解决。 而眼下需要讨论建立一个保证窗口完整性的方法。提到窗口完整性，一个最开始的想法是使用某种全局事件发生时间进展机制，比如水位线来解决。然而，水位线本身对数据处理的准确性有两个主要的影响\n\n水位线可能设置的过短，因此在水位线达到后仍然有记录到达。对于分布式的数据源头来说，很难去推断出一个完全完美的事件发生时间水位线，因此无法完全依赖于水位线，否则我们无法达到１００％的准确性。\n水位线可能设置的过长。因为水位线是全局性的进度指标，只要一个迟到的数据项就能影响到整个数据处理管道的水位线。就算是一个正常工作的数据处理管道，它的处理延迟波动很小，受输入源的影响，这种延迟的基准仍然可能有几分钟甚至更高。因此，使用水位线作为窗口完整信号并触发窗口计算结果很可能导致整个处理结果比Lambda架构有更高的延迟。\n\n由于上述的原因，我们认为光使用水位线是不够的。从 Lambda 架构中我们获得了规避完整性问题的启发：它不是尽快地提供完全准确的答案，而是说，它先是尽快通过流式处理管道提供一个最佳的低延迟估计，同时承诺最终会通过批处理管道提供正确的和一致的答案（当然前提条件是批处理作业启动时，需要的数据应该已经全部到达了；如果数据后期发生了变化，那么批处理要重新执行以获得准确答案）。如果我们要在一个单一的数据处理管道里做到同样的事情（不管采用哪种执行引擎），那么我们需要一种对任一窗口能够提供多种答案（或者可以叫做窗格 译者注：对窗口这个比喻的引申）的方式。我们把这种功能叫做“触发器”。这种“触发器”可以选择在何时触发指定窗口的输出结果。\n简单来说，触发器是一种受内部或者外信号激励的激发 GroupByKeyAndWindow 执行并输出执行结果的机制。他们对窗口模型是互补的，各自从不同的时间维度上影响系统的行为：\n\n窗口 决定哪些事件发生时间段（where）的数据被分组到一起来进行聚合操作\n触发 决定在什么处理时间（when）窗口的聚合结果被处理输出成一个窗格\n\n我们的系统提供了基于窗口的完成度估计的预定义触发器。（完成度估计基于水位线。完成度估计也包括水位线完成百分位。它提供了一种有效的处理迟到记录的语义，而且在批处理和流处理引擎中都适用。允许使用者处理少量的一部分的记录来快速获得结果，而不是痴痴地等待最后的一点点数据到来）。触发器也有基于处理时间的，基于数据抵达状况的（如记录数，字节数，数据到达标记（punctuations），模式匹配等）。我们也支持对基础触发器进行逻辑组合（与，或），循环，序列和其他一些复合构造方法。另外，用户可以基于执行引擎的元素（如水位计时器，处理时间计时器，数据到达，复合构造）和任意的外部相关信号（如数据注入请求，外部数据进展指标，RPC完成回调等）自定义触发器。在2.4里我们会更详细地看一些具体的例子。\n除了控制窗口结果计算何时触发，触发器还提供了三种不同的模式来控制不同的窗格（计算结果）之间是如何相互关联的。\n\n抛弃 窗口触发后，窗口内容被抛弃，而之后窗口计算的结果和之前的结果不存在相关性。当下游的数据消费者（不管是数据处理管道的内部还是外部）希望触发计算结果之间相互独立（比如对插入的数据进行求和的场景），那么这种情况就比较适用。另外，抛弃因为不需要缓存历史数据，因此对比其他两种模式，抛弃模式在状态缓存上是最高效的。不过累积性的操作可以建模成Dataflow的 Combiner，对窗口状态管理可以用增量的方式处理。对我们视频观看会话的用例来说，抛弃模式是不够的，因为要求下游消费者只关心会话的部分数据是不合理的。\n**累积：**触发后，窗口内容被完整保留住持久化的状态中，而后期的计算结果成为对上一次结果的一个修正的版本。这种情况下，当下游的消费者收到同一个窗口的多次计算结果时，会用新的计算结果覆盖掉老的计算结果。这也是Lambda架构使用的方式，流处理管道产出低延迟的结果，之后被批处理管道的结果覆盖掉。对视频会话的用例来说，如果我们把会话窗口的内容进行计算然后把结果直接写入到支持更新的输出源（如数据库或者键值存储），这种方案是足够的了。\n**累积和撤回：**出发后，在进行累积语义的基础上，计算结果的一份复制也被保留到持久化状态中。当窗口将来再次触发时，上一次的结果值先下发做撤回处理，然后新的结果作为正常数据下发。如果数据处理管道有多个串行的GroupByKeyAndWindow操作时，撤回是必要的，因为同一个窗口的不同触发计算结果可能在下游会被分组到不同键中去。在这种情况下，除非我们通过一个撤回操作，撤回上一次聚合操作的结果，否则下游的第二次聚合操作会产生错误的结果。Dataflow的combiner操作是支持撤回的，只要调用uncombine方法就可以进行撤回。而对于视频会话用例来说，这种模型是非常理想的。比如说，如果我们在下游从会话创建一开始，我们就基于会话的某些属性进行汇总统计，例如检查不受欢迎的广告（比如说在很多会话中这个广告的被观察时长不长于5秒）。早期的计算结果随着输入的增加（比如说原来在野外观看视频的用户已经回来了并上传了他们的日志）可能变得无效。对于包含多个阶段的聚合操作的复杂数据处理管道，撤回方式帮助我们应对源头数据的变化，得到正确的数据处理结果。（简单的撤回实现只能支持确定性的计算，而非确定性计算的支持需要更复杂，代价也更高。我们已经看到这样的使用场景，比如说概率模型 译者注：比如说基于布隆过滤器的UV统计）\n\n2.4 例子\n我们现在来考察一系列的例子来说明Dataflow模型支持的计算模式是非常普遍适用的。我们下面例子是关于2.2.3中提到的对整数求和的例子：\nPCollection&lt;KV&lt;String, Integer&gt;&gt; output = input\n  .apply(Sum.integersPerKey());\n\n我们假设从某个数据源我们观察到了10个数据点，每个数据点都是一个比较小的整数。我们会考虑有边界输入源和无边界输入源两种情况。为了画图简单，我们假设这些数据点的键是一样的，而生产环境里我们这里所描述的数据处理是多个键并行处理的。图5展示了数据在我们关心的两个时间轴上的分布。X轴是事件发生时间（也就是事件发生的时间），而Y轴是处理时间（即数据管道观测到数据的时间）。（译者注：圆圈里的数值是从源头采样到的数值）除非是另有说明，所有例子假设数据的处理执行都是在流处理引擎上。\n\n很多例子都要考虑水位线，因此我们的图当中也包括了理想的水位线，也包括了实际的水位线。直的虚线代表了理想的水位线，即，事件发生时间和数据处理时间不存在任何延迟，所有的数据一产生就马上消费了。不过考虑到分布式系统的不确定性，这两个时间之间有偏差是非常普遍的。在图5中，实际的水位线（黑色弯曲虚线）很好的说明了这一点。另外注意由于实际的水位线是猜测获得的，因此有一个迟到比较明显的数据点落在了水位线的后面。\n如果我们在传统的批处理系统中构建上述的对数据进行求和的数据处理管道，那么我们会等待所有的数据到达，然后聚合成一个批次（因为我们现在假设所有的数据拥有同样的键），再进行求和，得到了结果51。如图6所示黑色的长方形是这个运算的示意图。长方形的区域代表求和运算涵盖的处理时间和参与运算的数据的事件发生时间区间。长方形的上沿代表计算发生，获得结果的管道处理时间点。因为传统的批处理系统不关心数据的事件发生时间，所有的数据被涵盖在一个大的全局性窗口中，因此包含了所有事件发生时间内的数据。而且因为管道的输出在收到所有数据后只计算一次，因此这个输出包含了所有处理时间的数据（译者注：处理时间是数据系统观察到数据的时间，而不是运算发生时的时间。。）\n\n注意上图中包含了水位线。尽管在传统批处理系统中不存在水位线的概念，但是在语义上我们仍然可以引入它。批处理的水位线刚开始时一直停留不动。直到系统收到了所有数据并开始处理，水位线近似平行于事件发生时间轴开始平移，然后一直延伸到无穷远处。我们之所以讨论这一点，是因为如果让流处理引擎在收到所有数据之后启动来处理数据，那么水位线进展和传统批处理系统是一模一样的。（译者注：这提示我们其实水位线的概念可以同样适用于批处理）\n现在假设我们要把上述的数据处理管道改造成能够接入无边界数据源的管道。在Dataflow模型中，默认的窗口触发方式是当水位线移过窗口时吐出窗口的执行结果。但如果对一个无边界数据源我们使用了全局性窗口，那么窗口就永远不会触发（译者注：因为窗口的大小在不停地扩大）。因此，我们要么用其他的触发器触发计算（而不是默认触发器），或者按某种别的方式开窗，而不是一个唯一的全局性窗口。否则，我们永远不会获得计算结果输出。\n我们先来尝试改变窗口触发方式，因为这会帮助我们产生概念上一致的输出（一个全局的包含所有时间的按键进行求和），周期性地输出更新的结果。在这个例子中，我们使用了Window.trigger操作，按处理时间每分钟周期性重复触发窗口的计算。我们使用累积的方式对窗口结果进行修正（假设结果输出到一个数据库或者KV数据库，因而新的结果会持续地覆盖之前的计算结果）。这样，如图7所示，我们每分钟（处理时间）产生更新的全局求和结果。注意图中半透明的输出长方形是相互重叠的，这是因为累积窗格处理机制计算时包含了之前的窗口内容：\nPCollection&lt;KV&lt;String, Integer&gt;&gt; output = input \n  .apply(Window.trigger(Repeat(AtPeriod(1, MINUTE)))\n               .accumulating()) \n  .apply(Sum.integersPerKey());\n\n\n如果我们想要求出每分钟的和的增量，那么我们可以使用窗格的抛弃模式，如图8所示。注意这是很多流处理引擎的处理时间窗口的窗口计算模式。窗格不再相互重合，因此窗口的结果包含了相互独立的时间区域内的数据：\nPCollection&lt;KV&lt;String, Integer&gt;&gt; output = input\n  .apply(Window.trigger(Repeat(AtPeriod(1, MINUTE)))\n               .discarding()) \n  .apply(Sum.integersPerKey());\n\n\n另外一种更健壮的处理时间窗口的实现方式，是把数据摄入时的数据到达时间作为数据的事件发生时间，然后使用事件发生时间窗口。这样的另一个效果是系统对流入系统的数据的事件发生时间非常清楚，因而能够生成完美的水位线，不会存在迟到的数据。如果数据处理场景中不关心真正的事件发生时间，或者无法获得真正的事件发生时间，那么采用这种方式生成事件发生时间是一种非常低成本且有效的方式。\n在我们讨论其他类型的窗口前，我们先来考虑下另外一种触发器。一种常见的窗口模式是基于记录数的窗口。我们可以通过改变触发器为每多少条记录到达触发一次的方式来实现基于记录数的窗口。图9是一个以两条记录为窗口大小的例子。输出是窗口内相邻的两条记录之和。更复杂的记录数窗口（比如说滑动记录数窗口）可以通过定制化的窗口触发器来支持：\nPCollection&lt;KV&lt;String, Integer&gt;&gt; output = input \n  .apply(Window.trigger(Repeat(AtCount(2)))\n               .discarding())\n  .apply(Sum.integersPerKey());\n\n\n我们接下来考虑支持无边界数据源的其他选项，不再仅仅考虑全局窗口。一开始，我们来观察固定的2分钟窗口，累积窗格：\nPCollection&lt;KV&lt;String, Integer&gt;&gt; output = input\n .apply(Window.into(FixedWindows.of(2, MINUTES)\n               .accumulating())\n  .apply(Sum.integersPerKey());\n\n这里没有定义触发器，那么系统采用的是默认触发器。相当于：\nPCollection&lt;KV&lt;String, Integer&gt;&gt; output = input\n  .apply(Window.into(FixedWindows.of(2, MINUTES))\n               .trigger(Repeat(AtWatermark())))\n               .accumulating())\n  .apply(Sum.integersPerKey());\n\n水位线触发器是指当水位线越过窗口底线时窗口被触发。我们这里假设批处理和流处理系统都实现了水位线（详见3.1）。Repeat代表的含义是如何处理迟到的数据。在这里Repeat意味着当有迟于水位线的记录到达时，窗口都会立即触发再次进行计算，因为按定义，此时水位线早已经越过窗口底线了。\n图10-12描述了上述窗口在三种不同的数据处理引擎上运行的情况。首先我们来观察下批处理引擎上这个数据处理管道如何执行的。受限于我们当前的实现，我们认为数据源现在是有边界的数据源，而传统的批处理引擎会等待所有的数据到来。之后，我们会根据数据的事件发生时间处理，在模拟的水位线到达后窗口计算触发吐出计算结果。整个过程如图10所示：\n\n然后来考虑一下微批次引擎，每分钟做一次批次处理。系统会每分钟收集输入的数据进行处理，反复重复进行。每个批次开始后，水位线会从批次的开始时间迅速上升到批次的结束时间（技术上来看基本上是即刻完成的，取决于一分钟内积压的数据量和数据处理管道的吞吐能力）。这样每轮微批次完成后系统会达到一个新的水位线，窗口的内容每次都可能会不同（因为有迟到的数据加入进来），输出结果也会被更新。这种方案很好的兼顾了低延迟和结果的最终准确性。如图11所示：\n\n接下来考虑数据管道在流处理引擎上的执行情况，如图12所示。大多数窗口在水位线越过它们之后触发执行。注意值为9的那个数据点在水位线之后到达。不管什么原因（移动设备离线，网络故障分区等），系统并没有意识到那一条数据并没有到达，仍然提升了水位线并触发了窗口计算。当值为9的那条记录到达后，窗口会重新触发，计算出一个新的结果值。\n如果说我们一个窗口只有一个输出，而且针对迟到的数据仅做一次的修正，那么这个计算方式还是不错的。不过因为窗口要等待水位线进展，整体上的延迟比起微批次系统可能要更糟糕，这就是我们之前在2.3里所说的，单纯依赖水位线可能引起的问题（水位线可能太慢）\n\n如果我们想降低整体的延迟，那么我们可以提供按数据处理时间的触发器进行周期性的触发，这样我们能够尽早得到窗口的计算结果，并且在随后得到周期性的更新，直到水位线越过窗口边界。参见图13。这样我们能够得到比微批次系统更低的延迟，因为数据一到达就进入了窗口随后就可能被触发，而不像在微批次系统里必须等待一个批次数据完全到达。假设微批次系统和流处理系统都是强一致的，那么我们选择哪种引擎，就是在能接受的延迟程度和计算成本之间的选择（对微批次系统也是批大小的选择）。这就是我们这个模型想要达到的目标之一。参见图13：固定窗口，流处理，部分窗格。\nPCollection&lt;KV&lt;String, Integer&gt;&gt; output = input\n  .apply(Window.into(FixedWindows.of(2, MINUTES))\n               .trigger(SequenceOf(\n                   RepeatUntil(\n                       AtPeriod(1, MINUTE),\n                       AtWatermark()),\n                   Repeat(AtWatermark())))\n               .accumulating())\n  .apply(Sum.integersPerKey());\n\n\n作为最后一个例子，我们来看一下如何支持之前提到的视频会话需求（为了保持例子之间的一致性，我们继续把求和作为我们的计算内容。改变成其他的聚合函数也是很容易的）。我们把窗口定义为会话窗口，会话超时时间为1分钟，并且支持回撤操作。这个例子也体现了我们把模型的四个维度拆开之后带来的灵活的可组合性（计算什么，在哪段事件发生时间里计算，在哪段处理时间里真正触发计算，计算产生的结果后期如何进行修正）。也演示了对之前的计算结果可以进行撤回是一个非常强力的工具，否则可能会让下游之前接收到的数据无法得到修正。\nPCollection&lt;KV&lt;String, Integer&gt;&gt; output = input      .apply(Window.into(Sessions.withGapDuration(1, MINUTE))\n               .trigger(SequenceOf(\n                 RepeatUntil(\n                   AtPeriod(1, MINUTE),\n                   AtWatermark()),\n                   Repeat(AtWatermark())))\n                .accumulatingAndRetracting()) \n    .apply(Sum.integersPerKey());\n\n\n在这个例子中，我们首先接收到了数据5 和数据7。由于5和7之间事件发生时间大于1分钟，因此被当做了两个会话。在第一次窗口被触发时，产生了两条计算结果，和分别为5和7。在第二个因处理时间引起的窗口触发时，我们接收到了数据3,4,3，并且第一个3和上一个7之间时间大于1分钟，因此被分组到一个新的会话窗口，窗口触发计算并输出了计算结果10。紧接着，数据8到达了。数据8的到达使得数据7,3,4,3,8合并成了一个大窗口。当水位线越过数据点8后，新窗口计算被触发。触发后需要先撤回之前两个小窗口的计算结果，撤回方式是往下游发送两条键为之前的两个会话标记，值为-7和-10的记录，然后发送一个新的值为25的新窗口计算结果。同样，当值为9的记录迟于水位线到达后，之前的所有7条记录都合并成了一个会话，因此要对之前的会话再次进行撤回。值为-5和-25的记录又被发送往下游，新的值为39的会话记录随后也被发往下游。同样的操作在处理最后3条值为3,8,1的记录时也会发生，先是输出了结果值3，随后回撤了这个计算结果，输出了合并会话后的结果值12。\n3. 实现和设计\n3.1 实现\n我们已经用FlumeJava实现了这个模型，使用MillWheel作为底层的流执行引擎；在本文写作的时候，针对公有云服务Cloud Dataflow的重新实现也接近完成。由于这些系统要么是谷歌的内部系统，要么是共有云服务，因此为简洁起见，实现的细节我们略掉了。可以提及的让人感兴趣的一点是，核心的窗口机制代码，触发机制代码是非常通用的，绝大部分都同时适用于批处理引擎实现和流处理引擎实现。这个实现本身也值得在将来进行更进一步的分析。\n3.2 设计原则\n尽管我们很多的设计其实是受到3.3节所描述的真实业务场景启发，我们在设计中也遵从了一系列的核心原则。这些原则我们认为是这个模型必须要遵循的。\n\n永远不要依赖任何的数据完整性标记（译者注：如水位线）\n灵活性，要能覆盖已知的多样化的使用用例，并且覆盖将来可能的使用用例\n对于每个预期中的执行引擎，（模型抽象）不但要正确合理，而且要有额外的附加价值\n鼓励实现的透明性\n支持对数据在它们产生的上下文中进行健壮的分析。\n\n可以这么说，下述的使用案例决定了模型的具体功能，而这些设计原则决定了模型整体的特征和框架。我们认为这两者是我们设计的模型具有完全性，普遍性的根本原因。\n3.3 业务场景\n在我们设计Dataflow模型的过程中，我们考虑了FlumeJava和MillWheel系统在这些年遇到的各种真实场景。那些良好工作的设计，我们保留到了模型中，而那些工作不那么良好的设计激励我们采用新的方法重新设计。下面我们简单介绍一些影响过我们设计的场景。\n3.3.1 大规模数据回写和Lambda架构；统一模型\n有一些团队在MillWheel上跑日志链接作业。这其中有一个特别大的日志链接处理作业在MillWheel上按流模式运行，而另外一个单独的FlumeJava批处理作业用来对流处理作业的结果进行大规模的回写。一个更好的设计是使用一个统一的模型，对数据处理逻辑只实现一次，但是能够在流处理引擎和批处理引擎不经修改而同时运行。这是第一个激发我们思考去针对批处理，微批次处理和流处理建立一个统一模型的业务场景。这也是图10-12所展示的。\n有一些团队在MillWheel上跑日志链接作业。这其中有一个特别大的日志链接处理作业在MillWheel上按流模式运行，而另外一个单独的FlumeJava批处理作业用来对流处理作业的结果进行大规模的回写。一个更好的设计是使用一个统一的模型，对数据处理逻辑只实现一次，但是能够在流处理引擎和批处理引擎不经修改而同时运行。这是第一个激发我们思考去针对批处理，微批次处理和流处理建立一个统一模型的业务场景。这也是图10-12所展示的。\n3.3.2 非对齐窗口：会话\n从一开始我们就知道我们需要支持会话；事实上这是我们窗口模型对现有模型而言一个重大的贡献。会话对谷歌来说是一个非常重要的使用场景（也是MillWheel创建的原因之一）。会话窗口在一系列的产品域中都有应用，如搜索，广告，分析，社交和YouTube。基本上任何关心把用户的分散活动记录进行相互关联分析都需要通过会话来进行处理。因此，支持会话成为我们设计中的最重要考虑。如图14所示，支持会话在Dataflow中是非常简单的。\n3.3.3 支付：触发器，累加和撤回\n有两个在MillWheel上跑支付作业的团队遇到的问题对模型的一部分也有启发作用。当时我们的设计实践是使用水位线作为数据完全到达的指标。然后写额外的逻辑代码来处理迟到的数据或者更改源头数据。由于缺乏一个支持更新和撤回的系统，负责资源利用率方案的团队最终放弃了我们的平台，构建了自己独立的解决方案（他们最后使用的模型和我们同时设计开发的模型事实上非常类似）。另一个支付团队的数据源头有少部分缓慢到达的数据，造成了水位线延迟，这给他们带来了大问题。这些系统上的缺陷成为我们对现有系统需要进行改良设计的重要动因，并且把我们的考虑点从保证数据的完整性转移到了对迟到数据的可适应性。对于这个场景的思考总结带来了两个方面：一个方面是能够精确，灵活地确定何时将窗口内容物化的触发器（如7-14所示），对同样的输入数据集也可以使用多种多样地结果输出模式进行处理。另外一方面是通过累积和撤回能够支持增量处理。（图14）\n3.3.4 统计计算：水位线触发器\n很多MillWheel作业用来进行汇总统计（如平均延迟）。对这些作业来说，100%的准确性不是必须的，但是在合理的时间范围内得到一个接近完整的统计是必须的。考虑到对于结构化的输入（如日志文件），使用水位线就能达到很高程度的准确度。这些客户发现使用单次的的基于水位线的触发器就可以获得高度准确的统计。水位线触发器如图12所示。\n我们有一些滥用检测的作业运行在MillWheel中。滥用检测是另外一种快速处理大部分数据比缓慢处理掉所有数据要远远更有价值的场景。因此，他们会大量地使用水位线百分位触发器。这个场景促使我们在模型中加入了对水位线百分位触发器的支持。\n与此相关的，批处理作业中的一个痛点是部分处理节点的缓慢进度会成为执行时间中的长尾，拖慢整个进度。除了可以通过动态平衡作业来缓解这个问题，FlumeJava也支持基于整体完成百分度来选择是否终止长尾节点。用统一模型来描述批处理中遇到的这个场景的时候，水位线百分位触发器可以很自然地进行表达，不需要在引入额外的定制功能、定制接口。\n3.3.5 推荐：处理时间触发器\n另外一种我们考虑过的场景是从大量的谷歌数据资产中构建用户活动树（本质上是会话树）。这些树用来根据用户的兴趣来做推荐。在这些作业中我们使用处理时间作为触发器。这是因为，对于用户推荐来说，周期性更新的，即便是基于不完备数据的用户活动树比起持续等待水位线越过会话窗口边界（即会话结束）获得完全的数据要有意义的多。这也意味着由于部分少量数据引起的水位线进展延迟不影响基于其他已经到达的数据进行计算并获得有效的用户活动树。考虑到这种场景，我们包含了基于处理时间的触发器（如图7和图8所示）\n3.3.6 异常探测：数据驱动和组合触发器\n在MillWheel的论文中，我们描述了一种用来检测谷歌网站搜索查询趋势的微分异常探测数据处理管道。当我们为模型设计触发器的时候，这种微分异常探测系统启发我们设计了数据驱动触发器。这种微分探测器检测网站检索流，通过统计学估计来计算搜索查询请求量是否存在一个毛刺。如果系统认为一个毛刺即将产生，系统将发出一个启动型号。当他们认为毛刺已经消除，那么他们会发出一个停止信号（译者注：可能会对接系统自动对系统扩容或缩容）。尽管我们可以采用别的方式来触发计算，比如说Trill的标点符(Punctuations)，但是对于异常探测你可能希望一旦系统确认有异常即将发生，系统应该立即输出这个判断。标点符的使用事实上把流处理系统转换成了微批次处理系统，引入了额外的延迟。在调查过一些用户场景后，我们认为标点符不完全适合我们。因此我们在模型中引入了可定制化数据驱动触发器。同时这个场景也驱使我们支持触发器组合，因为在现实场景中，一个系统可能在处理多种微分计算，需要根据定义的一组逻辑来支持多种多样的输出。图9中的AtCount触发器是数据驱动触发器的例子，而图10-14使用了组合触发器。\n4. 总结\n在MillWheel的论文中，我们描述了一种用来检测谷歌网站搜索查询趋势的微分异常探测数据处理管道。当我们为模型设计触发器的时候，这种微分异常探测系统启发我们设计了数据驱动触发器。这种微分探测器检测网站检索流，通过统计学估计来计算搜索查询请求量是否存在一个毛刺。如果系统认为一个毛刺即将产生，系统将发出一个启动型号。当他们认为毛刺已经消除，那么他们会发出一个停止信号（译者注：可能会对接系统自动对系统扩容或缩容）。尽管我们可以采用别的方式来触发计算，比如说Trill的标点符(Punctuations)，但是对于异常探测你可能希望一旦系统确认有异常即将发生，系统应该立即输出这个判断。标点符的使用事实上把流处理系统转换成了微批次处理系统，引入了额外的延迟。在调查过一些用户场景后，我们认为标点符不完全适合我们。因此我们在模型中引入了可定制化数据驱动触发器。同时这个场景也驱使我们支持触发器组合，因为在现实场景中，一个系统可能在处理多种微分计算，需要根据定义的一组逻辑来支持多种多样的输出。图9中的AtCount触发器是数据驱动触发器的例子，而图10-14使用了组合触发器。\n根据我们多年在谷歌处理大规模无边界数据的实践经验，我们相信我们提出的模型一个非常好的进展。它支持非对齐，事件发生时间窗口。这些都是当前用户所需要的。它提供了灵活的窗口触发机制，支持窗口累积和撤回，把关注点从寻求等待数据的完整性变为自动适应现实世界中持续变更的数据源。它对批处理，微批次，流处理提供了统一的抽象，允许数据开发人员灵活从三者中选择。同时，它避免了单一系统容易把系统本身的构建蔓延到数据处理抽象层面中去的问题。它的灵活性让数据开发者能根据使用场景恰当地平衡数据处理的准确性，成本和延迟程度。对于处理多样化的场景和需求来说，这一点很关键。最后，通过把数据处理的逻辑划分为计算什么，在哪个事件发生时间范围内计算，在什么处理时间点触发计算，如何用新的结果订正之前的数据处理结果让整个数据处理逻辑透明清晰。我们希望其他人能够认同这个模型并且和我们一起推进这个复杂而又令人着迷的领域的发展。\n","id":"https://wendajiang.github.io/dataflow-model/","title":"dataflow_model"},"https://wendajiang.github.io/distribute-algs-roadmap/":{"body":"开发分布式系统最关键的是根据场景特点，选择合适的算法，在一致性和可用性之间折中\n分布式算法的四度空间：\n协议拜占庭容错一致性性能可用性\n2PC（2阶段提交协议）否强一致性低低\nTCC否最终一致性低低\nPaxos否强一致性中中\nZAB否最终一致性中中\nRaft否强一致性中中\nGossip否最终一致性高高\nQuorum

CAP 理论，该理论由加州大学伯克利分校的 Eric Brewer 教授提出，阐述了在一个分布式系统中不可能同时满足一致性（ C onsistency）、可用性（ A vailability），以及分区容错性（ P artition Tolerance）。\n\n一致性: 在分布式系统中数据往往存在多个副本，一致性描述的是这些副本中的数据在内容和组织上的一致。\n可用性: 描述系统对用户的服务能力，所谓可用是指在用户能够容忍的时间范围内返回用户期望的结果。\n分区容错性: 分布式系统通常由多个节点构成，由于网络是不可靠的，所以存在分布式集群中的节点因为网络通信故障导致被孤立成一个个小集群的可能性，即网络分区，分区容错性要求在出现网络分区时系统仍然能够对外提供一致性的可用服务。\n\n对于一个分布式系统而言，我们要始终假设网络是不可靠的，因此分区容错性是对一个分布式系统最基本的要求，我们的切入点更多的是尝试在可用性和一致性之间寻找一个平衡点，但这也并非要求我们在系统设计时一直建立在网络出现分区的前提之上，然后对一致性和可用性在选择时非此即彼。\nEric Brewer 教授在 2012 年就曾指出 CAP 理论证明不能同时满足一致性、可用性，以及分区容错性的观点在实际系统设计指导上存在一定的误导性。  传统对于 CAP 理论的理解认为在设计分布式系统时必须满足 P，然后在 C 和 A 之间进行取舍，这是片面的。实际中网络出现分区的可能性还是比较小的，尤其是目前网络环境正在变得越来越好，甚至许多系统都拥有专线支撑，所以在网络未出现分区时，还是应该兼顾 A 和 C。另外就是对于一致性、可用性，以及分区容错性三者在度量上也应该有一个评定范围，最简单的以可用性来说，当有多少占比请求出现响应超时才可以被认为是不满足可用性，而不是一出现超时就认为是不可用的。最后我们需要考虑的一点就是分布式系统一般都是一个比较大且复杂的系统，我们应该从更小的粒度上对各个子系统进行评估和设计，而不是简单的从整体上武断决策。\n让分布式集群始终对外提供可用的一致性服务一直是富有挑战和趣味的任务。暂且抛开可用性，拿一致性来说，对于关系型数据库我们通常利用事务来保证数据的强一致性，但是当我们的数据量越来越大，大到单库已经无法承担时，我们不得不采取分库分表的策略对数据库实现水平拆分，或者引入 NoSQL 技术，构建分布式数据库集群以分摊读写压力，从而提升数据库的存储和响应能力，但是多个数据库实例也为我们使用数据库带来了许多的限制，比如主键的全局唯一、联表查询、数据聚合等等，另外一个相当棘手的问题就是数据库的事务由原先的单库事务变成了现在的分布式事务。\n分布式事务的实现并不是无解的，比如下文要展开的两阶段提交（2PC:Two-Phase Commit）和三阶段提交（3PC:Three-Phase Commit）都给我们提供了思路，但是在分布式环境下如何保证数据的强一致性，并对外提供高可用的服务还是相当棘手的，因此很多分布式系统对于数据强一致性都敬而远之。\n两阶段提交协议 (2PC: Two-Phase Commit )\n两阶段提交协议的目标是在于为分布式系统保证数据的一致性，许多分布式协议采用该协议提供对分布式事务的支持。顾名思义，该协议将一个分布式的事务过程拆分为两个阶段:投票和事务提交。为了让整个数据库集群能够正常运营，改协议指定了一个协调者单点，用于协调整个数据库集群各节点的运行。为了简化描述，我们将数据库集群中的各个节点称为参与者，三阶段提交协议中同样包含协调者和参与者这两个角色定义。\n第一阶段:投票\n该阶段的主要目的是在于打探数据库集群中的各个参与者是否能够正常执行事务，具体步骤如下:\n\n协调者向所有的参与者发送事务执行请求，并等待参与者反馈事务执行结果\n事务参与者收到请求后，执行事务但是不提交，并记录事务日志\n参与者将自己事务执行情况反馈给协调者，同时阻塞等待协调者的后续指令\n\n第二阶段:事务提交\n经过第一阶段的协调者询问之后，各个参与者回复自己事务的执行情况，存在三种可能:\n\n所有参与者都回复能正常执行事务\n一个或者多个参与者回复事务执行失败\n协调者等待超时\n\n对于第一种情况，协调者向所有参与者发出提交事务的通知，具体步骤如下:\n  sequenceDiagram;\n  协调者 -&gt;&gt; 参与者集群:1. 询问各参与者事务是否可以正常执行;\n  参与者集群 -&gt;&gt; 参与者集群:1.1 执行事务，但不提交;\n  参与者集群 -&gt;&gt; 协调者:1.2 所有参与者均能成功执行事务;\n  协调者 -&gt;&gt; 参与者集群:2. 向所有参与者发起事务提交通知;\n  参与者集群 -&gt;&gt; 参与者集群:2.1 提交事务，并释放资源;\n  参与者集群 -&gt;&gt; 协调者:2.2 反馈事务提交结果;\n\n对于第二或者第三种情况，协调者认为参与者无法成功执行事务，为了整个集群的数据一致性，所以要向各个参与者发送事务回滚通知，具体步骤如下:\n  sequenceDiagram;\n  协调者 -&gt;&gt; 参与者集群:1. 询问各参与者事务是否可以正常执行;\n  参与者集群 -&gt;&gt; 参与者集群:1.1 执行事务，但不提交;\n  参与者集群 -&gt;&gt; 协调者:1.2 一个或者多个事务为成功执行，或者未在约定时间内返回结果;\n  协调者 -&gt;&gt; 参与者集群:2. 向所有参与者发起事务回滚通知;\n  参与者集群 -&gt;&gt; 参与者集群:2.1 回滚事务，并释放资源;\n  参与者集群 -&gt;&gt; 协调者:2.2 反馈事务回滚结果;\n\n两阶段提交协议是为了解决分布式数据库的强一致性问题，实际应用中更多用来解决事务操作的原子性，下图描绘了协调者参与者的状态转换:\n\n  stateDiagram-v2\n    S --&gt; WAIT: vote request\n    WAIT --&gt; ROLLBACK: some fail\n    WAIT --&gt; COMMIT: all success\n    ROLLBACK --&gt; E\n    COMMIT --&gt; E\n\n\n协调者状态转换\n\n\n  stateDiagram-v2\n    S --&gt; READY: vote response\n    S --&gt; ROLLBACK: timeout\n    READY --&gt; ROLLBACK: do rollback\n    READY --&gt; COMMIT: do commit\n    ROLLBACK --&gt; E\n    COMMIT --&gt; E\n\n\n参与者状态转换\n\n站在协调者的角度，在发起投票之后就进入了 WAIT 状态，等待所有参与者回复各自事务执行状态，并在收到所有参与者的回复后决策下一步是发送 commit 或 rollback 信息。站在参与者的角度，当回复完协调者的投票请求之后便进入 READY 状态（能够正常执行事务），接下去就是等待协调者最终的决策通知，一旦收到通知便可依据决策执行 commit 或 rollback 操作。\n两阶段提交协议原理简单、易于实现，但是缺点也是显而易见的，包含如下:\n\n单点问题\n\n协调者在整个两阶段提交过程中扮演着举足轻重的作用，一旦协调者所在服务器宕机，就会影响整个数据库集群的正常运行。比如在第二阶段中，如果协调者因为故障不能正常发送事务提交或回滚通知，那么参与者们将一直处于阻塞状态，整个数据库集群将无法提供服务。\n\n同步阻塞\n\n两阶段提交执行过程中，所有的参与者都需要听从协调者的统一调度，期间处于阻塞状态而不能从事其他操作，这样效率极其低下。\n\n数据不一致性\n\n两阶段提交协议虽然是分布式数据强一致性所设计，但仍然存在数据不一致性的可能性。比如在第二阶段中，假设协调者发出了事务 commit 通知，但是因为网络问题该通知仅被一部分参与者所收到并执行了 commit 操作，其余的参与者则因为没有收到通知一直处于阻塞状态，这时候就产生了数据的不一致性。\n针对上述问题可以引入 超时机制 和 互询机制 在很大程度上予以解决。\n对于协调者来说如果在指定时间内没有收到所有参与者的应答，则可以自动退出 WAIT 状态，并向所有参与者发送 rollback 通知。对于参与者来说如果位于 READY 状态，但是在指定时间内没有收到协调者的第二阶段通知，则不能武断地执行 rollback 操作，因为协调者可能发送的是 commit 通知，这个时候执行 rollback 就会导致数据不一致。\n此时，我们可以介入互询机制，让参与者 A 去询问其他参与者 B 的执行情况。如果 B 执行了 rollback 或 commit 操作，则 A 可以大胆的与 B 执行相同的操作；如果 B 此时还没有到达 READY 状态，则可以推断出协调者发出的肯定是 rollback 通知；如果 B 同样位于 READY 状态，则 A 可以继续询问另外的参与者。只有当所有的参与者都位于 READY 状态时，此时两阶段提交协议无法处理，将陷入长时间的阻塞状态。\n三阶段提交协议 (3PC: Three-Phase Commit)\n针对两阶段提交存在的问题，三阶段提交协议通过引入一个 预询盘 阶段，以及超时策略来减少整个集群的阻塞时间，提升系统性能。三阶段提交的三个阶段分别为:预询盘（can_commit）、预提交（pre_commit），以及事务提交（do_commit）。\n第一阶段:预询盘\n该阶段协调者会去询问各个参与者是否能够正常执行事务，参与者根据自身情况回复一个预估值，相对于真正的执行事务，这个过程是轻量的，具体步骤如下:\n\n协调者向各个参与者发送事务询问通知，询问是否可以执行事务操作，并等待回复；\n各个参与者依据自身状况回复一个预估值，如果预估自己能够正常执行事务就返回确定信息，并进入预备状态，否则返回否定信息。\n\n第二阶段:预提交\n本阶段协调者会根据第一阶段的询盘结果采取相应操作，询盘结果主要有 3 种:\n\n所有的参与者都返回确定信息。\n一个或多个参与者返回否定信息。\n协调者等待超时。\n\n针对第 1 种情况，协调者会向所有参与者发送事务执行请求，具体步骤如下:\n\n协调者向所有的事务参与者发送事务执行通知；\n参与者收到通知后执行事务但不提交；\n参与者将事务执行情况返回给客户端。\n\n在上述步骤中，如果参与者等待超时，则会中断事务。  针对第 2 和第 3 种情况，协调者认为事务无法正常执行，于是向各个参与者发出 abort 通知，请求退出预备状态，具体步骤如下:\n\n协调者向所有事务参与者发送 abort 通知；\n参与者收到通知后中断事务。\n\n  sequenceDiagram;\n  协调者 -&gt;&gt; 参与者集群:1. 向各个参与者发送 can_commit 请求，询问是否可以执行事务;\n  参与者集群 -&gt;&gt; 协调者:1.1 如果存在一个或者多个参与者返回不能执行事务，或者超时;\n  协调者 -&gt;&gt; 参与者集群:2. 向各个参与者发送 abort 通知;\n  参与者集群 -&gt;&gt; 参与者集群:2.1 收到通知或者等待超时，执行中断事务操作;\n\n第三阶段:事务提交\n如果第二阶段事务未中断，那么本阶段协调者将会依据事务执行返回的结果来决定提交或回滚事务，分为 3 种情况:\n\n所有的参与者都能正常执行事务。\n一个或多个参与者执行事务失败。\n协调者等待超时。\n\n针对第 1 种情况，协调者向各个参与者发起事务提交请求，具体步骤如下:\n\n协调者向所有参与者发送事务 commit 通知；\n所有参与者在收到通知之后执行 commit 操作，并释放占有的资源；\n参与者向协调者反馈事务提交结果。\n\n  sequenceDiagram;\n  协调者 -&gt;&gt; 参与者集群:1. 向各个参与者发送 can_commit 请求，询问是否可以执行事务;\n  参与者集群 -&gt;&gt; 协调者:1.1 如果存在一个或者多个参与者返回不能执行事务，或者超时;\n  协调者 -&gt;&gt; 参与者集群:2. 向各个参与者发送 pre_commit 请求;\n  参与者集群 -&gt;&gt; 参与者集群:2.1

返回事务提交结果;\n\n针对第 2 和 3 种情况，协调者认为事务无法成功执行，于是向各个参与者发送事务回滚请求，具体步骤如下:\n\n协调者向所有参与者发送事务 rollback 通知\n所有参与者在收到通知之后执行 rollback 操作，并释放占有的资源\n参与者向协调者反馈事务回滚操作\n\n  sequenceDiagram\n  协调者 -&gt;&gt; 参与者集群:1.

返回事务执行结果\n  协调者 -&gt;&gt; 协调者:3. 如果存在一个或者多个事务不能正常执行，或者等待超时\n  协调者 -&gt;&gt; 参与者集群:4. 向各个参与者发送回滚通知\n  参与者集群 -&gt;&gt; 参与者集群:4.1 收到回滚通知，执行回滚操作\n  协调者 -&gt;&gt; 参与者集群:4.2 返回事务回滚结果\n\n在本阶段如果协调者或者网络问题，导致参与者迟迟不能收到来自协调者的 commit 或者 rollback 请求，那么参与者将不会如两阶段提交中那样陷入阻塞，而是等待超时后继续 commit，相对于两阶段提交虽然降低了同步阻塞，但是还是无法完全避免数据的不一致\n\n  stateDiagram-v2\n    S --&gt; WAIT: vote request\n

Option, Maybe, Error, which, when coupled with ad dataflow-style of programming and pattern matching, feel far more natural. This approach removes several majar drawbacks to return codes that we're about to discuss, especially compared to C. Rust has largely adopted this model but has some exciting things with it for system programmers.\nDispite theis simplicity, return codes do some with some baggage; in summary:\n\nperformance can suffer (branch that compiler can't optimize)\nProgramming model usabiliry can be poor\nThe biggie: you can accidentally forget to check for errors (Rust guaratee by compiler)\n\n上面文章也提到 Rust 在除了性能之外的方面已经做的很好 (pattern matching and try! macro)\nBut we need fail-fast -&gt; exception\nException\ncpp deprecate exception specifications, so noexcept is also bad. cpp exception\nrecap\nthe goodthe badthe ugly\nError Code1. All function that can fail are explicit annotated2. All error handling at callsites is explicit1. you can forget to check them2. Performance of success paths suffersusability is often subpar\nAll Excpetionsfirst class language support1. Performance is typically worse than it could be2. handling is often done in a non-local manner, where less information about an error is known(goto-like)\nUnchecked Exceptionsconducive to rapid development where dealing with errors reliably isn't criticalAnything can fail without warning from the languagereliability is as bad as it gets\nChecked Exceptionsall function that can fail are explicitly annotated1. callsites aren't explicit about can fail and error propagation2. systems that let some subset of exceptions go unchecked poison the well(not all errors are explicit)people hate them(in java, at least)\n\nWouldn't it be great if we could take all of the Goods and leave out the Bads and The Uglies?\nBugs aren't recoverable errors\n\nA recoverable error is usually the result of programmatic data validation.\nA bug is a kind of error the programmer didn't expect.\n\n\nThe wrong point: Exceptions and return codes are equally expressive, they should however not be used to describe errors. For example, the return codes contained definitions like ARRAY_INDEX_OUT_OF_RANGE. It cannot be handled or fixed at runtime, it can only be fixed by its developer. Thus there should be no according return code, but instead there should be assert.\n\nReliabiliry, Fault-Tolerance, and Isolation\nTo build a reliable system\nAs with most distributed systems, our architecture assumed process failure was inevitable. We went to great length to defend aginst cascading failures, journal regularly, and to enable restartability of programs and services.\nAbandonment\nPerhaps the most important technique is regularly journaling and checkpointing precious persistent state. Jim Gray’s 1985 paper, Why Do Computers Stop and What Can Be Done About It?, describes this concept nicely.\nRecoverable errors: type-directed exceptions\nFor example, file I/O, network I/O, parsing data, validating user data.\nThe exception has good performance on the good path, it's zero-cost.\nRestrospective and conslusion\nThe final model in the article featured:\n\nAn architecture that assumed fine-grained isolation and recoverability from failure.\nDistinguishing between bugs and recoverable errors.\nAssertions, abandonment for all bugs\n\n\nSo next, we should look at the C++ system. And if we do not use exception, how to introduce the Rust smell code into C++.\nBoost.outcome , std::expected, and boost.leaf\nBoost.outcome.result is more like std::variant, and std::expected(C++23) is more like std::optional extension.

So we need the lock. Programmers annotate source code with locks, putting them around critical sections, and thus ensure that any such critical section executes as if it were a single atomic instruction.\nlock_t mutex; // some globally-allocated lock 'mutex'\n...\nlock(&amp;mutex);\nbalance = balance + 1;\nunlock(&amp;mutex);\n\nHow to build a Spin lock\nBy now, you should have some understanding of how a lock works, from the perspective of a programmer. But how should we build a lock? What hardware support is needed? What OS support? \nEvaluating Locks\n\nThe first is whether the lock does its basic task, which is to provide mutual exclusion. \nThe second is fairness. Does each thread contending for the lock get a fair shot at acquiring it once it is free? \nThe final criterion is performance, specifically the time overheads added by using the lock.\n\nno contention, when a single thread is running and grabs and releases the lock, what's the overhead?\nmultiple threads are contending for the lock on a single CPU\nhow does the lock perform when there are multiple CPUs involved, and threads on each contending for the lock?\n\n\n\nControlling Interrputs\nThe earliest solutions used to provide mutual exclusion was to disable interrupts for critical sections. This solution was invented for single-processor systems.\nvoid lock() {\n  DisableInterrupts();\n}\nvoid unlock() {\n  EnableInterrupts();\n}\n\nPositive:\n\neasy, don't have to scratch your head too hard to figure out why this works.\n\nNegatives:\n\nallow any calling thread to perform privileged operation(turning interrupts on and off)\n\nif one greedy program could call lock() at the beginning of its execution and thus monopolize the process\nworse, call lock() and go into an endless loop, the OS can't regain the control of the system\n\n\ndoes not work on multiprocessors\nturning off interrupts for extended periods of time can lead to interrupts becoming lost, which can lead to serious systems problems.\ninefficient\n\nSo this approach is not fact. Turning off interrupts is only used in limited contexts as a mutual-exclusion primitive.\nA failed attempt: Just using loads/stores\ntypedef struct ___lock_t { int flag; } lock_t;\nvoid init(lock_t *mutex) {\n  mutex-&gt;flag = 0;\n}\n\nvoid lock(lock_t *mutex) {\n  while(mutex-&gt;flag == 1);  // spin-wait (do nothing)\n  mutex-&gt;flag = 1;\n}\n\nvoid unlock(lock_t *mutex) {\n  mutex-&gt;flag = 0;\n}\n\nThe idea is simple: use a simple variable to indicate whether some thread has possession of a lock.\n\nBut it's wrong. As you can see the above pic, both threads set the flag to 1 and both threads are thus bale to enter the critical secion.\nBuilding working spin locks with test-and-set\nAs disabling interrupts does not work on multiple processors, and because simple approaches using loads and stores (as shown above) don't work, system designers started to invent hardware support for locking.\ntest-and-set(atomic exchange) instruction. We use the follow cpp snippet code to describe:\nint TestAndSet(int *old_ptr, int new) {\n  int old = *old_ptr;\n  *old_ptr = new;\n  return old\n}\n\nWhat the test-and-set instruction does is as follows.\ntypedef struct ___lock_t { int flag; } lock_t;\nvoid init(lock_t *lock) {\n  lock-&gt;flag = 0;\n}\n\nvoid lock(lock_t *lock) {\n  while(TestAndSet(&amp;lock-&gt;flag, 1) == 1);  \n}\n\nvoid unlock(lock_t *lock) {\n  lock-&gt;flag = 0;\n}\n\nRethinking last section's problem, as the test-and-set is atomically operation, that problem never happen.\nIt's the simplest type of lock to build, and simply spins, using CPU cycles, until the lock becomes available. To work correctly on single processor, it requires a preemptive scheduler(i.e., one that will interrupt a thread via a timer, in order to run a different thread, from time to time).\nEvaluating Spin Locks\n\nCorrectness. ✅\nFairness? ❌, spin locks don't provide any fairness guarantees.\nPerformance？\n\nsingle processor: waste of CPU cycles\nmultiple CPUs, work reasonably well (if the number of threads roughly equals the number os CPUs).  The critical section is short, and spin thread soon require the lock, avoid the thread context swap\n\n\n\nCompare-and-swap\nAnother hardware primitive that some systems provide is known as the compare-and-swap instruction.(or compare-and-exchange). The C pseudocode is below:\nint CompareAndSwap(int *ptr, int expected, int new) {\n  int original = *ptr;\n  if (original == expected) {\n    *ptr = new;\n  }\n  return original;\n}\n\nvoid lock(lock_t *lock) {\n  while(CompareAndSwap(&amp;lock-&gt;flag, 0, 1) == 1);\n}\n\nAlthough, compare-and-swap is more powerful instruction than test-and-set in the situation of lock-free synchronization. However, if we just build a simple spin lock with it, its behavior is identical to the spin lock we analyzed above.\nLoad-linked and Store-conditional\nMIPS architecture, for example, the load-linked and store-conditional instructions can be used in tandem to build locks and other concurrent structures. The C pseudocode for these instructions is as below. Alpha, PowerPC, and ARM provide similar instructions.\nint LoadLinked(int *ptr) {\n  return *ptr;\n}\nint StoreConditional(int *ptr, int value) {\n  if (no update to *ptr since LoadLinked to this address) {\n    *ptr = value;\n    return 1;\n  } else {\n    return 0;\n  }\n}\n\nThe lock can be built as below.\nvoid lock(lock_t *lock) {\n  while(1) {\n    while(LoadLinked(&amp;lock-&gt;flag) == 1); // spin until it's zero\n    if (StoreConditional(&amp;lock-&gt;flag, 1) == 1) return;\n  }\n}\n\nSmart undergraduate student suggested a more concise form of the above.\nvoid lock(lock_t *lock) {\n  while(LoadLinked(&amp;lock-&gt;flag) || !StoreConditional(&amp;lock-&gt;flag, 1)); \n}\n\nFetch-and-add\nOne final hardware primitive is the fetch-and-add instruction, which atomically increments a value while returning the old value at a particular address. The C pseudocode look like this:\nint FetchAndAdd(int *ptr) {\n  int old = *ptr;\n  *ptr = old + 1;\n  return old;\n}\n\nWe can use fetch-and-add to build a more interesting ticket lock.\ntypedef struct __lock_t {\n  int ticket;\n  int turn;\n} lock_t;\nvoid lock_init(lock_t *lock) {\n  lock-&gt;ticket = 0;\n  lock-&gt;turn = 0;\n}\nvoid lock(lock_t *lock) {\n  int myturn = FetchAndAdd(&amp;lock-&gt;ticket);\n  while(lock-&gt;turn != myturn); // spin\n}\nvoid unlock(lock_t *lock) {\n  lock-&gt;turn = lock-&gt;turn + 1;\n}\n\nNote one important difference with this solution versus our previous attempts: it ensures progress for all threads. Once a thread is assigned its ticket value, it will be scheduled at some point in the future(once those in front of it have passed through the critical section and released the lock).\nHow to avoid spinning\nSimple approach: just yield\nOur first try is simple and friendly approach: when you are going to spin, instead give up the CPU to another thread.\nvoid init() {\n  flag = 0;\n}\nvoid lock() {\n  while(TestAndSet(&amp;flag, 1) == 1)\n    yield();\n}\nvoid unlock() {\n  flag = 0;\n}\n\nYield is simply a system call that moves the caller from the running state to the ready state, and thus promotes another thread to running.\nBut, we have not tackled the starvation problem at all.\nUsing queues: sleeping instead of spinning\nThe real problem with our previous approaches is that they leave too much to change. The scheduler determines which thread runs next; if the scheduler makes a bad choice, a thread runs that must either spin waiting for the lock (our first approach), or yield the CPU immediately (our second approach). Either way, there is potential for waste and no prevention of starvation.\nThus, we must explicitly exert some control over which thread next gets to acquire the lock after the current holder releases it. A queue to keep track of which threads are waiting to acquire the lock\n\n​spin lock maybe cause priority inversion.\nAssume T1, T2, and T1 has lower priority. T1 only runs when T2 is not able to do so(e.g. when T2 is blocked on I/O).\nNow the problem. Assume T2 is blocked for some reason. So T1 runs, grabs a spin lock, and enters a critical section. T2 now become unblocked, and the CPU scheduler immediately schedules it. Now T2 tries to acquire the lock, and it can't, it just keeps spinning. Because the lock is a spin lock, T2 spins forever, and the system is hung.\nsolution is: priority inheritance, more generally, a higer-priority thread waiting for a lower-priority thread can temporarily boost the lower thread's priority, thus enabling it to run and overcoming the inversion.\n\nLinux provides a futex which is similar to the Solaris interface but provides more in-kernel functionality. Specifically, each futex has associated witch it a specific physical memory location, as well as a per-futex in-kernal queue. Callers can use futex call to sleep and wake as need be.\nvoid mutex_lock(int *mutex) {\n  int v;\n  // bit 31 was clear, we got the mutex\n  if (atomic_bit_test_set(mutex, 31) == 0) return;\n  atomic_increment(mutex);\n  while(1) {\n    if (atomic_bit_test_set(mutex, 31) == 0) {\n      atomic_decrement(mutex);\n      return;\n    }\n    // we have to waitfirst make sure the futex value we monitoring is truly negative(locked)\n    v = *mutex;\n    if (v &gt;= 0) continue;\n    futex_wait(mutex, v);\n  }\n}\n\nvoid mutex_unlock(int *mutex) {\n  // adding 0x80000000 to counter results in 0 if and only if there are not other intersted threads\n  if (atomic_add_zero(mutex, 0x80000000)) return;\n  // there are other threads waiting for this mutex, wake one of them up.\n  futex_wake(*mutex);\n}\n\nTwo-phase locks\nOne final note: the Linux approach has the flavor the an old approach , and is now referred to as a two-phase lock. A two-phase lock realizes that spinning can be useful, particularly if the lock is about to be released. So in the first phase, the lock spins for a while, hoping that is can acquire the lock.\nHowever, if the lock is not acquired during the first spin phase, a second phase is entered, where the caller is put to sleep, and only woken up when the lock becomes free later. The Linux lock above is a form of such a lock, but it only pins once; a generalization of this could spin in a loop for a fixed amount of time before using futex support to sleep.\n两阶段锁，是 hybrid 方法的一个很好实例，结合两个好想法变成更好的一个方法。当然这取决于很多因素，硬件环境，线程数量，工作负载情况。总之，做一个通用的适用于所有情况的锁仍然是一个挑战。\n","id":"https://wendajiang.github.io/essay/ostep28/","title":"threads-locks"},"https://wendajiang.github.io/essay/ostep30/":{"body":"In particular, there are many cases where a thread wishes to check whether a condition is true before continuing its execution. For example, a parent thread might wish to check whether a child thread has completed before continuing (this is often called a join); how should such a wait be implemented? Let's look at one example:\nvoid *child(void *arg) {\n  printf(\"child\\n\");\n  /// how to indicate we are done?\n  return NULL;\n}\nint main() {\n  printf(\"parent: begin\\n\");\n  pthread_t c;\n  pthread_create(&amp;c, nullptr, child, nullptr);\n  /// how to wait for child\n  printf(\"parent: end\\n\");\n  return 0;\n}\n\nThe first approach is using a shared varaible, like follow:\nvolatile int done = 0;\nvoid *child(void *arg) {\n  printf(\"child\\n\");\n  done = 1;\n  return NULL;\n}\nint main() {\n  printf(\"parent: begin\\n\");\n  pthread_t c;\n  pthread_create(&amp;c, nullptr, child, nullptr);\n  while(!done); // spin\n  printf(\"parent: end\\n\");\n  return 0;\n}\n\nBut it is inefficient as parent spins and wastes CPU time. What we would like here insead is some way to put the parent to sleep until the condition we are waiting for (e.g. the child is done executing) comes ture.\nDefinition and Routines\nTo wait for a condition to become true, a thread can make use of what is known as a conditino variable. A condition variable is an explicit queue that threads can put themselves on when some state of execution(i.e. some condition) is not as desired(by waiting on the condition); some other thread, when it changes said state, can then wake one(or more) of those waiting threads and thus allow them to continue(by signaling on the condition).\nThe idea goes back to Dijkstra's use of private semaphores.\nA condition variable has two operations associated with it: wait() and signal().\n\nthe wait() call is executed when a thread wishes to put itself to sleep\nthe signal() call is executed when a thread has changed something in the program and thus wants to wake a sleeping thread waiting on this condition.\n\nLet's show the last paragraph example:\nint done = 0;\npthread_mutex_t m = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;\npthread_cond_t cv = PTHREAD_COND_INITIALIZER;\n\nvoid thr_exit() {\n  pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;m);\n  done = 1;\n  pthread_cond_signal(&amp;cv);\n  pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;m);\n}\n\nvoid *child(void *arg) {\n  printf(\"child\\n\");\n  thr_exit();\n  return NULL;\n}\n\nvoid thr_join() {\n  pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;m);\n  while(done == 0) \n    pthread_cond_wait(&amp;cv, &amp;m);\n  pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;m);\n}\n\nint main() {\n  printf(\"parent: begin\\n\");\n  pthread_t p;\n  pthread_create(&amp;p, NULL, child, NULL);\n  thr_join();\n  printf(\"parent: end\\n\");\n}\n\nOne thing you might notice about the wait() call is that it also takes a mutex as a parameter; it assumes that this mutex is blocked when wait() is called. The responsibility of wait() is to release the lock and put the calling thread to sleep (atomically); when the thread wakes up, it must re-acquire the lock before returning to the caller. This purpose is to prevent certain race conditions from occurring when a thread is trying to put itself to sleep.\nThere are two case that maybe happen:\n  sequenceDiagram\n  parent-&gt;&gt;child: thr_join\n  parent-&gt;parent: wait() and release the lock\n  child-&gt;&gt;child: acquire the lock and set done\n  parent-&gt;parent: return from wait() wich lock held and continue\n\n  sequenceDiagram\n  child -&gt;&gt; child: acquire the lock and set done\n  parent -&gt; parent: wait() directly return and continue\n\nOne last noe: you might observe that the parent use a while loop instead of just an if stmt when deciding whether to wait on the condition. \n\nIf we remove the state variable done, what is happened?\nThink about, first child calls thr_exit immediately; in this case, the child will signal, but there is no thread asleep on the condition. When the parent runs, it will simply call wait and be stuck; no thread will ever wake it.\nIf we remove the mutext ? The issue here is a subtle race condition. \n\nLet's explain if stmt problem in the bounded-buffer problem(producer/consumer)\nint buffer;\nint count = 0;\n\nint loops;\ncond_t cond;\nmutext_t mutex;\n\nvoid put(int value) {\n  assert(count == 0);\n  count = 1;\n  buffer = value;\n}\nint get() {\n  assert(count == 1);\n  count = 0;\n  return buffer;\n}\n\nvoid *producer(void *arg) {\n  int i;\n  for (i = 0; i &lt; loops; i++) {\n    pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;mutex);              // p1\n    if (count == 1)                          // p2\n      pthread_cond_wait(&amp;cond, &amp;mutex);      // p3\n    put(i);                                  // p4\n    pthread_cond_signal(&amp;cond);              // p5\n    pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;mutex);            // p6\n  }\n}\n\nvoid *consumer(void *arg) {\n  int i;\n  for(i = 0; i &lt; loops; i++) {\n    pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;mutex);             // c1\n    if (count == 0)                         // c2\n      pthread_cond_wait(&amp;cond, &amp;mutex);     // c3\n    int temp = get();                       // c4\n    pthread_cond_signal(&amp;cond);             // c5\n    pthread_mutext_unlock(&amp;mutex);          // c6\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", temp);\n  }\n}\n\none-producer and one-consumer this works. However, if we have more than one of these threads, the solution has two critical problems. What are they?\nIf stmt cause race conditon:\nTC1 StateTC2 StateTPcountComment\nc1  runreadyready0\nc2  runreadyready0\nc3  sleepreadyready0\nsleepreadyp1 run0\nsleepreadyp2 run0\nsleepreadyp4 run1buffer now fill TC1 awoken\nreadyreadyp5 run1\nreadyreadyp6 run1\nreadyreadyp1 run1\nreadyreadyp2 run1\nreadyreadyP3 sleep1buffer rull; sleep tc2 sneaks in...\nreadyc1 runsleep1\nreadyc2 runsleep1\nreadyc4 runsleep0... and grabs data TP awoken\nreadyc5 runready0\nreadyc6 runready0\nc4 runreadyready0Oh ho!

This style, known as event-based concurrency.\nThe problem that event-based concurrency addresses is two-fold.\n\nManageing concurrency correctly in multi-threaded applications.\n\nmissing locks, deadlock, and so on.\n\n\nIn a multi-threaded application, the developer has little or no control over what is scheduled at a given moment in time\n\nThe programmer simply creates threads and then hopes that the underlying OS schedules them in a reasonable manner across avaiable CPUs.\n\n\n\n\nhow to build concurrent servers without threads\n\nAn Event Loop\nYou simple wait for something(i.e., an \"event\") to occur; when it does, you check what type of event it is and do the small amout of work it requires.\nCanonical event-based server pseudocode:\nwhile(1) {\n  events = get_events();\n  for (e in events) {\n    process_event(e);\n  }\n}\n\nBut this leaves us with a bigger question: how exactly does an event-based server determine which events are taking place?\nImport API: select/poll/epoll\nThese interfaces enable a program to do is simple: check whether there is any incomming I/O that should be attended to.\n\nBlocking vs. Non-Blocking Interfaces\nBlocking(or synchronous) interface do all of their work before returning to the caller; non-blocking(or asynchronous) interfaces begin some work but return immediately, thus letting whatever work that needs to be doen get done in the background.\nNon-blocking interfces are essential in the event-based approach, as a call that blocks will halt all progress.\n\nWhy simpler? No locks needed\nWith a single CPU and an event-based application, the problems found in concurrent programs are no longer present. Specifically, because only one event is being handled at a time, there is no need to acquire or release locks.\nA problem: blocking system calls\nWith an event-based approach ,however, there are no other threads to run: just the main event loop. And this implies that if an event handler issues a call that blocks, the entire server will do just that: block until the call completes. When the event loop blocks, the system sits idle, and thus is a huge potential waste of resources. We thus have a rule that must be obeyed in event-based systems: no blocking calls are allowed.\nA solution: asynchronous I/O\nloop check the asynchronous issue completed.\nAnother problem: state management\nThread-based code is more simpler. Packaging up some program state for the next event handler is not needed in thread-based programs, as the state the program need is on the stack of the thread.\nFor example, within a thread-based server:\nint rc = read(fd, buffer, size);\nrc = write(sd, buffer, size);\n\nDoing this kind of work is trivial. But in an event-based system, life is not so easy. You must manually manage the state of program.\nThe solution sounds complicated, the idea is rahter simple: basically, record the needed information to finish processing this event in some data structure; when the event happens(i.e., when the disk I/O complates), look up the needed information and process the event.\nWhat is still difficult with events\n\nwhen systems moved from a single CPU to multiple CPUs, in order to utilize more than one CPU, the event server has to run multiple event handlers in parallel; when doing so, the usual syschronization problems(e.g., critical sections) arise.\nimplicit blcking. Event though the server has been structured to avoid explicit blocking, page faults is hard to avoid.\nhard to manager over time\nasynchronous disk I/O is never quite integrates with asynchronous network I/O in as simple and uniform a manaer. you maybe need some combination of select() for networking and the AIO calls for disk I/O\n\nreference\n\nstaged event-based concurrency\n\n","id":"https://wendajiang.github.io/essay/ostep33/","title":"Event-based Concurrency"},"https://wendajiang.github.io/essay/pp-fromjourneyman-to-master/":{"body":"\n务实的哲学\n\n\n团队信任对于创造力和协作至关重要，  关键时刻信任的破坏几乎无法修复 ( 跑路？\n\n\n提供选择，别找借口 -- 小黄鸭编程\n\n\n破窗理论 -- 不要因为一些危急的事情，造成附加伤害，尽可能控制软件的熵\n\n\n人们都觉得，加入一个推进中的成功项目更容易一些 ( 煮石头汤的故事\n\n\n永远审视项目，不要做温水青蛙\n先养成仔细观察周围环境的习惯，然后在项目中这样做\n\n\n知识和经验是你最重要的专业资产，但是它们是时效资产\n学习新事物的能力是你最重要的战略资产\n知识组合：\n\n\n定期投资 -- 安排一个固定的时间和地点学习\n\n每年学习一门新语言\n每月读一本技术书\n读非技术书\n上课 -- 了解公司之外的人都在做什么\n尝试不同的环境 -- makefile -&gt;

Let's see an example to understand the problem better.\nLet's say we have a balance.dat file storing the balance of an account, and it has an initial value of \"100\". Our concurrent system has two processes to update the balance value:\n\nProcess A: reads the current value, substracts 20 and saves the result back to the file.\nProcess B: reads the current value, adds 80 and writes the result back into the file.\n\nObviously, after the execution of two processes, we are expects the file has value: 100 - 20 + 80 = 160.\nHowever, an interdecing update problem may occur in this problem:\n\nProcess A reads the file's current value(100), and prepares to do further calculation.\nProcess B now reads the same file and gets the current balance(100).\nProcess A calculates 100 - 20 and saves the result 80 back to the file\nProcess B doesn't know the balance has been updated since its last read. So it will still use the stale value 100 to calculate 100 + 80 and write the result 180 to the file.\n\nAs a result, we have 180 in the balance.dat file instead of the expected value of 160.\nFile locking in Linux\nFile locking is a mechanism to restrict access to a file among muliple processes. It allows only one process to access the file in a specific time, thus avoiding the interceding update problem.\nLinux supports two kinds of the file locks: advisory locks and mandatory locks.\nAdvisory lock\nAdvisory locking is not an enforced locking scheme. It will work only if the partipating processes are cooperating by explicityly acquiring locks. Otherwise, advisory locks will be ignored if a process is not aware of locks at all.\nSystem call flock is an advisory lock.\nMandaroty locking\nBefore we start looking at mandaroty file locking, we should keep in mind that Linx implementation of mandaroty locking is unreliable.\nUnlike advisory locking, mandatory locking doesn't require any cooperation between the paricipating processes. Once a mandatory lock is avrivated on a file, the operating system prevents other processes from reading or writing the file.\nTo enable mandatory file locking in Linux, two requirements must be satisfield.\n\nwe must mount the file system with the mand option (mount -o mand FILESYSTEM MOUNT_POINT)\nwe must turn on the set-group-ID bit and turn off the group-execute bit for the files we are about to lock (chmod g+s,g-x FILE)\n\nInspect all locks in a system\nthe lslocks command\nWe can use this command to see all the currently locked files in the system.\n/proc/locks\nIt is a file in the procfs virtual file system. The file holds all current file locks, the lslocks command relies on this file to generate the list, too.\nIntroduction to flock command\nflock command is also provided by the util-linux package.\nflock FILE_TO_LOCK COMMAND\n\nexmaple\n#!/bin/bash\nfile=\"balance.dat\"\nvalue=$(cat $file)\necho \"Read current balance:$value\"\n\n#sleep 10 seconds to simulate business calculation\nprogress=10\nwhile [[ $progress -lt 101 ]]; do\n\techo -n -e \"\\033[77DCalculating new balance..$progress%\"\n\tsleep 1\n\tprogress=$((10+progress))\ndone\necho \"\"\n\nvalue=$((value+$1))\necho \"Write new balance ($value) back to $file.\" \necho $value &gt; \"$file\"\necho \"Done.\"\n\nWe create a simple shell script a.sh to simulate process A:\n#!/bin/bash\n#-----------------------------------------\n# process A: lock the file and subtract 20 \n# from the current balance\n#-----------------------------------------\nflock --verbose balance.dat ./update_balance.sh '-20'\n\nNow let's start process A to test:\n$ ./a.sh \nflock: getting lock took 0.000002 seconds\nflock: executing ./update_balance.sh\nRead current balance:100\nCalculating new balance..100%\nWrite new balance (80) back to balance.dat.\nDone.\n\nThrough the output, we can see the flock command first acquired a lock on the file balance.dat, then the update_balance.sh script read and updated the file.\nDuring its run, we can check the lock information via the lslocks command:\n$ lslocks | grep \"balance\"\nflock  825712 FLOCK 4B WRITE 0 0 0 /tmp/test/balance.dat\n\nThe output shows that the flock command is holding a WRITE lock on the entire file /tmp/test/balance.dat\nreference\n\nFile locking.hpp\nman 2 flock\nman 2 readlink\nfile hard link\n\n","id":"https://wendajiang.github.io/file-locking/","title":"file locking"},"https://wendajiang.github.io/gcc-compile-options/":{"body":"onenote 迁移文\noption解释\n-L指定链接库需要的目录 -L/usr/lib\n-l链接库名称 -ltest.    -Wl,-Bstatic 静态库 -Wl,-Bdynamic 动态库\n-I头文件目录\n-shared指定生成的动态库\n-fPICshared library 独立位置代码，如果不用，每个使用 so 的 binary 会 copy 到自己进程空间一份，无法实现真正的 share library\ngcc -E test.c -o test.i预处理\ngcc -S test.i -o test.s编译\ngcc -c test.s -o test.o汇编\ngcc test.o -o test链接\n-O编译优化 -O0, -O1(default), -O2, -O3\n-g生成gdb 调试信息\n-pggprof extra code\n-Wall所有的警告信息 -W 很多选项\n-Wl传递给 linker 的 option。-Wl,-R runtime lib 路径\n-Wa传递给 assmbler 的 option\n\n\nar 工具可以将 object file 压缩到一起，ex. ar cqs libstaticlib.a one.o two.o three.o\n\n","id":"https://wendajiang.github.io/gcc-compile-options/","title":"gcc/g++ compile options"},"https://wendajiang.github.io/gnu-binutils-md/":{"body":"\nGNU Binutils\nGNU Binutils\nGNU Binutils 是一套二进制工具集，主要由：\n\nld -- 链接器 \nas -- 汇编器\n\n还包括\n\n\naddr2line - Converts addresses into filenames and line numbers.\nbacktrace/backtrace_symbol 输出的地址可以使用addr2line转化为 \n\n\nar - A utility for creating, modifying and extracting from archives.\nar，Linux系统的一个备份压缩命令，用于创建、修改备存文件（archive），或从备存文件中提取成员文件。ar命令最常见的用法是将目标文件打包为静态链接库。\n\n\nc++filt - Filter to demangle encoded C++ symbols.\n将符号转为代码,比如 \nc++filt    _Z6myfunci    -&gt; myfunc(int)   (centos 系统示例)\n\n\ngold - A new, faster, ELF only linker, still in beta test.\n暂时忽略\n\n\ngprof - Displays profiling information.\n\n\nnlmconv - Converts object code into an NLM.\n\n\nnm - Lists symbols from object files.\n\n\nobjcopy - Copies and translates object files.\n\n\nobjdump - Displays information from object files.\n\n\nranlib - Generates an index to the contents of an archive.\n\n\nreadelf - Displays information from any ELF format object file.\n\n\nsize - Lists the section sizes of an object or archive file.\n例子：\nsize bt_test\ntext    data     bss     dec     hex filename\n2553     672      16    3241     ca9 bt_test\n\n\nstrings - Lists printable strings from files.\n\n\nstrip - Discards symbols.\n\"脱裤\"，将文件中的符号表脱掉，\"脱裤\"后的文件无法使用addr2line来转化代码位置\n\n\nwindows？暂时不管\n\ndlltool - Creates files for building and using DLLs.\nwindmc - A Windows compatible message compiler.\nwindres - A compiler for Windows resource files.\n\n大多数程序使用 BFD(Binary File Descriptor library)来做 manipulation。其中很多还是用 opcodes 库来汇编和反汇编机器指令\n参考\nar,nm,ranlib使用详解\n附录\nnl -- 列出文件以及行数\n","id":"https://wendajiang.github.io/gnu-binutils-md/","title":"GNU gcc 工具集整理, GNU Binutils"},"https://wendajiang.github.io/how-cpp-resolves-a-function-call/":{"body":"src\n\nThis is how the compiler, given a function call expression, figures out exactly which function to call. These steps are enshrined in the C++ standard. Every C++ compiler must follow them, and the whole thing happens at compile time for every function call expression evaluated by the program. \nI imagine the overall intent of the algorithm is to \"do what the programmer expects\", and to some extent, it's successful at that. You can get pretty far ignoring the algorithm altogether.\nName Lookup\nnamespace galaxy {\n  struct Asteroid {\n    float radius = 12;\n  };\n  void blast(Asteroid* ast, float force);\n}\n\nstruct Target {\n  galaxy::Asteroid* ast;\n  Target(galaxy::Asteroid* ast): ast{ast} {}\n  operator galaxy::Asteroid*() const {return ast;}\n};\n\nbool blast(Target target);\ntemplate&lt;typename T&gt; void blast(T* obj, float force);\n\nvoid play(galaxy::Asteroid* ast) {\n  blast(ast, 100);\n}\n\nThere are three main types of name lookup:\n\nMember name lookup occurs when a name is to the right of a a or -&gt; token, as in foo-&gt;bar. This type of lookup is used to locate class members\nQualified name lookup occurs when a name has a :: token in it, like std::sort. This type of name is explicit. The part to the right of the :: token is only looked up in the scope identified by the left part.\nUnqualified name lookup is neither of those. When the compiler sees an unqualified name, like blast, it looks for matching declarations in various scopes depending on the context. There's a detailed set of rules that determine exactly where the compiler should look.\n\nIn our case, we have an unqualified name. Now when name lookup is performed for a function call expression, the compiler may find multiple declarations. Let's call these declarations candidates. In the example above, the compiler finds three candidates:\nvoid galaxy::blast(galaxy::Asteroid* ast, float force);\nbool blast(Target target);\ntemplate&lt;typename T&gt; void blast(T* obj, float force);\n\nThe first candidate, deserves extra attention because is demenstrates a feature of C++ that's easy to overlook: argument-dependent lookup, or ADL for short. Here’s a quick summary in case you’re in the same boat. Normally, you wouldn’t expect this function to be a candidate for this particular call, since it was declared inside the galaxy namespace and the call comes from outside the galaxy namespace. There’s no using namespace galaxy directive in the code to make this function visible, either. So why is this function a candidate?\nThe reason is because any time you use an unqualified name in a function call – and the name doesn’t refer to a class member, among other things – ADL kicks in, and name lookup becomes more greedy. Specifically, in addition to the usual places, the compiler looks for candidate functions in the namespaces of the argument types – hence the name “argument-dependent lookup”.\nThe complete set of rules governing ADL is more nuanced than what I’ve described here, but the key thing is that ADL only works with unqualified names. For qualified names, which are looked up in a single scope, there’s no point. ADL also works when overloading built-in operators like + and ==, which lets you take advantage of it when writing, say, a math library.\nInterestingly, there are cases where member name lookup can find candidates that unqualified name lookup can’t. See this post by Eli Bendersky for details about that.\nSpecial handling of function template\nSome of the candidates found by name lookup are functions; others are function templates. There’s just one problem with function templates: You can’t call them. You can only call functions. Therefore, after name lookup, the compiler goes through the list of candidates and tries to turn each function template into a function.\nOverload resolution\nAt this stage, all of the function templates found during name lookup are gone, and we’re left with a nice, tidy set of candidate functions. This is also referred to as the overload set. Here’s the updated list of candidate functions for our example:\nvoid galaxy::blast(galaxy::Asteroid* ast, float force);\nbool blast(Target target);\nvoid blast&lt;galaxy::Asteroid&gt;(galaxy::Asteroid* obj, float force);\n\nThe next two steps narrow down this list even further by determining which of the candidate functions are viable – in other words, which ones could handle the function call.\nAfter using the caller’s arguments to filter out incompatible candidates, the compiler proceeds to check whether each function’s constraints are satisfied, if there are any. Constraints are a new feature in C++20. They let you use custom logic to eliminate candidate functions (coming from a class template or function template) without having to resort to SFINAE. They’re also supposed to give you better error messages. Our example doesn’t use constraints, so we can skip this step. (Technically, the standard says that constraints are also checked earlier, during template argument deduction, but I skipped over that detail. Checking in both places helps ensure the best possible error message is shown.)\nTiebreakers\nAt this point in out example, we're down to two viable functions. Either of them could handle the original function call just fine:\nvoid galaxy::blast(galaxy::Asteroid* ast, float force);\nvoid blast&lt;galaxy::Asteroid&gt;(galaxy::Asteroid* obj, float force);\n\nIndeed, if either of the above functions was the only viable one, it would be the one that handles the function call. But because there are two, the compiler must now do what it always does when there are multiple viable functions: It must determine which one is the best viable function. To be the best viable function, one of them must “win” against every other viable function as decided by a sequence of tiebreaker rules.\nFirst tiebreaker: Better-matching parameters wins\nthe two method are identical parameter types. So neither is better than the other.\nSecond tiebreaker: Non-template function wins\nSo the first method wins.\nThird tiebreaker: More specialized template wins\nIf it wasn't found, we would move on to the third tiebreaker.\nThere are several more tiebreakers in addition to the ones listed here. For example, if both the spaceship &lt;=&gt; operator and an overloaded comparison operator such as &gt; are viable, C++ prefers the comparison operator. And if the candidates are user-defined conversion functions, there are other rules that take higher priority than the ones I’ve shown. Nonetheless, I believe the three tiebreakers I’ve shown are the most important to remember.\nNeedless to say, if the compiler checks every tiebreaker and doesn’t find a single, unambiguous winner, compilation fails with an error message similar to the one shown near the beginning of this post.\nAfter the function call is resolved\nWe’ve reached the end of our journey. The compiler now knows exactly which function should be called by the expression blast(ast, 100). In many cases, though, the compiler has more work to do after resolving a function call:\n\nIf the function being called is a class member, the compiler must check that member’s access specifiers to see if it’s accessible to the caller.\nIf the function being called is a template function, the compiler attempts to instantiate that template function, provided its definition is visible.\nIf the function being called is a virtual function, the compiler generates special machine instructions so that the correct override will be called at runtime.\n\n","id":"https://wendajiang.github.io/how-cpp-resolves-a-function-call/","title":"How C++ resolves a function call"},"https://wendajiang.github.io/ieee-1800-2017-chapter35/":{"body":"35.1 General\n按照下面的方面来描述：\n\nDirect programming interface (DPI) tasks and functions\nDPI layers\nImporting and exporting functions\nImporting and exporting tasks\nDisabling DPI tasks and functions\n\n35.2 Overview\n本节强调 DPI 并提供了 SystemVerilog 接口层面的详细描述。C 层面在附录\nDPI 是 SV 和其他语言的接口。包含了两个部分：SV 层和其他语言层，这两个部分是分离的。实际上，哪种语言在使用 DPI 对于 SV 来说是透明无关的。SV 的编译器和其他语言的编译器都不需要分析对方的代码。不同的编译语言都可以支持 DPI。不过，现在 SV 只定义了 C 语言的接口。\n动机来自两个方面。接口的方法论要求应该可以允许构建异构系统（design 或者 testbench）。另一方面，也有一些实际需要要连接已经存在的代码，通常使用 C/C++ 写成，而不需要 VPI 的知识和开销。\nDPI 依据黑箱原则：组件的规范和实现分离，每个组件的实现对系统其他部分是透明的。因此，真实编程语言中的实现也是透明的，即使目前只有 C 语言的语法支持。其他语言和 SV 分离基于使用函数作为 SV unit 的自然封装。总的来说，任何函数都可以看作黑盒，并以透明的方式在 SV 或者其他语言中实现，并且不需要修改调用方。\n35.2.1 Tasks and functions\nDPI 允许两侧的语言直接进行调用。需要强调的是，在外部语言实现，在 SV 中调用的函数称为 imported function。在外部语言中调用的 SV 的函数称为 exported functions。DPI 允许通过函数参数和结果在两种语言之间传递，没有内部开销。\n也可以通过执行任务跨越语言边界。外部语言可以调用 SV task，SV 也可以调用 imported task。imported task 有 SV task 相同的语义：没有返回值，会消耗模拟时间。\n在 DPI 中使用的所有函数都假定会立刻执行完不消耗模拟时间，就像 SV 的函数一样。DPI 除了通过数据交换和显式传输的控制，没有提供同步的手段。\n每个 imported subroutine 需要被声明。而且这个声明相当于 SV 的实现，当然实际上是在外部语言实现的。同样的外部 subroutine 可以用来实现多个 SV 的 task 和 function（这对于相同的 subroutine 提供不同的默认参数很有用），但是一个给定的 name 在 SV 的一个 scope 只能使用一次。Imported 函数可以有零个或者多个参数（formal input, output, inout）。Imported 任务总是没有返回值，所以可以用在 statement context。\nDPI 完全基于 SV 结构构造的。imported 函数使用上就像 SV 函数一样。除了少数功能，调用起来一样。这可以有效减少学习曲线。类似的语义相似性也存在于 imported 任务和 SV 任务。\n35.2.2 Data types\nSV 的数据类型是唯一可以跨越语言边界的数据类型。不能直接使用其他语言中的数据类型。SV 中丰富的数据类型子集都可以用于 imported 和 exported 函数参数，当然也有一些限制和一些符号扩展。函数返回类型只限于 small values，但是请参考35.5.5\nimported 函数的参数可以是 open arrays，参考35.5.6.1\n35.2.2.1 Data representation\nDPI 并没有在 SV 的数据类型实现增加任何约束。优化 representation 依赖平台。2- or 4-state packed structrues 和 arrays 的 layout 实现依赖平台。\n4-state values, structures, arrays 的 representation 和 layout 与 SV 语义无关，并且只作用于外部语言的接口。\n35.3 Two layers of DPI\nDPI 包含了两个部分：SV 和外部语言。SV 只要求实现支持 C 的协议和链接。\n35.3.1 DPI SystemVerilog layer\nDPI 的 SV 侧不依赖外部语言。特别的是，外部语言的函数调用协议和参数传递机制对 SV 是透明的。无论外部代码如何 SV 代码看起来都应该相同。SV 侧的接口语义应该与外部语言的接口语义独立。\n本章不会描述完整的接口规范，只是描述 SV 侧接口的功能，语义和语法。另一半外部接口侧，参数传递机制，如何从外部代码访问到参数，请参考附录\n35.3.2 DPI foreign language layer\n外部语言接口侧应该规定参数如何传递，如何从外部代码被访问，SV 规范的数据类型如何被表征，如何与预定义的类似 C 的类型转换。\n被允许的参数数据类型和返回类型基本就是 SV 的数据类型（加一些限制和 open arrays 的额外扩展）。用户负责在外部代码中的参数使用 SV 等效的数据类型。像是 SV 编译器这种软件工具可以方便地生成正确 SV 的外部代码的函数头（头文件声明）。\nSV 编译器或者模拟器应该使用外部语言使用的函数调用协议和参数传递机制生成。相同的 SV 代码应该可以兼容不同的外部语言，尽管数据方法访问在不同语言中不同。附录定义了 C 语言的外部语言规范。\n35.4 Global name space of imported and exported functions\n每个 imported 的 subroutine 都应该对应一个全局符号。类似的，每个 exported 定义了一个全局符号。因此 SV 的 imported 和 exported 的函数和任务都自己的全局命名空间在链接中，不同于编译单元的 scope 命名空间。全局符号命名应该是唯一的，并且与 C 语言的命名保持一致（ABI 兼容）；尤其是，名字应该以字母或者下划线开头，后面可以是数字或者字母或者下划线。但是 exported 和 imported 的任务和函数应该可以使用 local 的 SV 命名声明，它们允许用户指定一个全局名字。如果与 SV 的关键字和保留字冲突，应该使用 escaped identifier 形式。\\ 反斜线符号和结尾空白应该被 SV 工具忽略。最后的链接符号应该符合 C 标准。如果全局命名没有被显式指定，就等于 SV 的 subroutine 命名。比如：\nexport \"DPI-C\" f_plus = function \\f+; // \"f+\" exported as \"f_plus\"\nexport \"DPI-C\" function f; // \"f\" exported under its own name\nimport \"DPI-C\" init_1 = function void \\init[1] (); // \"init_1\" is a linkage name\nimport \"DPI-C\" \\begin = funciton void \\init[2] (); // \"begin\" is a linkage name\n\n相同的全局 subroutine 可以被多个在不同 scope 的 import 声明引用（参考35.5.4）\n多个 export 声明也可以使用同一个 C 的标识符，隐式或者显式，在不同的 scope 使用同样的类型声明（35.5.4 中定义的 imported 任务和函数）。多个 export 声明使用同一个 C 标识符在同样的 scope 是被禁止的。\n【略：deprecated \"DPI\" 版本】\n35.5 Imported tasks and functions\nimported 的函数类似 SV 本身的函数\n35.5.1 Required properties of imported tasks and functions - semantic constraints\n本小节定义 imported subroutine 的语义约束。有些限制是 subroutine 共同的。有些依赖特定的 properties pure (35.5.2), context(35.5.3)。SV 编译器无法验证这些限制；如果有些限制没有被满足，这些 imported subroutine 调用就会有不可预知的影响。\n35.5.1.1 Instant completion of imported functions\nimported 函数不消耗模拟时间。\n35.5.1.2 input, output and inout arguments\nimported 函数可以有 input, output, inout 参数。input 参数不可被修改。\nimported 函数不可以对 output 参数的初始值有什么假设，是未定义的。\nimported 函数可以访问 inout 参数的初始值，inout 参数的修改是外部可见的。\n35.5.1.3 Special properties pure and context\n一个结果严格依赖 input 参数的函数，并且没有 side effect 可以看作 pure。这通常可以更好的优化，并且在模拟中有很好的性能。35.5.2 详细说明了 pure 函数应该遵守的规则。imported 任务不能被声明为 pure\nimported subroutine 会调用 exported subroutines 或者反问 SV 的数据对象而不是参数（比如通过 VPI）应该称为 context。对 context 函数和任务的调用会影响 SV 编译器的优化；因此当不必要的 context 被指定会影响模拟性能。没有声明 context 的 subroutine 对于 VPI 的调用或者 exported SV subroutine 的调用会导致未定义行为，非常危险。35.5.3 详细说明了非 context subroutine 应该遵守的限制。\n如果 pure, context 都没有声明，imported subroutine 不应该访问 SV 数据对象，并且也可以写入文件或者修改全局变量（施加 side effect）。\n35.5.1.4 Memory management\n外部代码和 SV 代码分配和持有的内存空间是分开的。自己负责自己分配的空间。尤其是，imported 函数不应该释放 SV 代码申请的内存反之亦然。\n35.5.1.5 Reentrancy of imported tasks\n对于 imported 的调用会导致当前执行线程的挂起，这发生于 imported 任务调用了一个 exported 任务，exported 任务中执行了延迟操作，事件控制，或者等待语句。因此 imported 任务的 C 代码可能在多个执行线程中活跃。C 开发者应该考虑可重入性。比如使用静态变量，确保使用了线程安全的 C 标准库 API。\n35.5.1.6 C++ exceptions\n可能会使用 C++ 完成 imported 函数和任务，即使在接口上遵循了 C 约束。如果使用 C++，异常不能传递出来。如果跨语言边界存在异常会导致未定义行为。\n35.5.2 Pure functions\npure函数如果它的结果不需要，或者之前有相同参数的调用，可以被消除。只有有返回值，并且没有 ouput 和 inout 参数的函数可以被声明为 pure。pure 函数的返回值只依赖于 input 参数，没有 side effect。这种函数的调用可能被 SV 编译器优化掉或者使用之前的值代替。\n特别的是，pure函数假定不会直接或者间接执行以下操作：\n\n文件操作\n读写操作，包括 I/O，环境变量，操作系统或者其他进程的对象，共享内存，socket 等\npersistent 数据的访问，比如全局或者静态变量。\n\n如果 pure没有遵守这些约束，SV 编译器的优化会导致不可预测的行为。\n35.5.3 Context tasks and functions\n有些 DPI imported subroutines 需要知道调用它们的上下文。需要特殊的调用来支持这种上下文；比如，一个关联“当前实例”的内部变量需要被赋值。为了避免不必要的开销，SV 代码中 imported subroutine 的特殊调用只会标签 context 发生。\nDPI export 任务和函数必须知道被调用的时机，包括被 import 调用的 SV 上下文。当 import 调用 export 之前先调用了 svSetScope ，显式设置了上下文。否则，上下文就是调用处实例 scope 的上下文。因为不同实例 scope 的 import 可以 export 相同的 subroutine，在 elaboration 之后可能存在多个 export 实例。在进行 svSetScope 之前，这些 export 实例有不同的上下文反映不同的 imported 调用者实例 scope。\n通过外部语言支持的一些其他接口（比如 VPI 回调）的 subroutine ，也可以调用 svSetScope 或者 DPI scope 相关的 API。外部语言 subroutine 也可以调用 svSetScope 指定的上下文中的 export subroutine。DPI scope 相关的 API 行为和 DPI export subroutine 的请求由模拟器定义，超出了 DPI 定义的 scope。\ncall chains 的概念对于理解 context 如何在 SV 和外部语言之间控制转换很有帮助。为了描述清晰，使用 inter-language call 表示跨语言调用，intra-language call 在 SV 或者外部语言内部的调用，不跨语言。\nDPI import 调用链是 inter-language 调用链，从 SV 到外部语言定义的 subroutine。SV 的调用开始点称为调用链的根。调用链可以包含多个 inter-language call 和多个 intra-language call 。\n\n对于 context subroutine 的调用会阻止 SV 编译器优化。\n35.5.4 Import declarations\n每个 imported 的 subroutine 都需要声明。声明的格式如下\n\n任务的返回值总是 int 类型，所以外部函数定义也使用 int。\nimport 声明指定了 subroutine 名字，函数返回类型，参数类型。也可以提供可选的参数默认值。参数名字也是可选的，除非需要名字绑定。import 函数声明也可以可选 pure or context标注，import 任务声明可选 context  标注。\n由于 import 声明等于 SV 内部的定义，所以在同一个 scope 不能出现多次相同的 import 声明。\ndpi_spec_string 可以是 \"DPI-C\" 或者 \"DPI\"。\"DPI\" 用来表明要用到 SV 已经弃用的 packed array 参数传递语义。在这种语义下，参数传递机制不同。并且会给出编译器警告或者错误：\n\n\"DPI\" is deprecated and should be replaced with \"DPI-C\"\nUse of the \"DPI-C\" string may require changes in the DPI application's C code.\n\nc_identifier 提供了给外部语言的链接名称。如果没有，就使用 SV 的 subroutine 名字。链接名称需要满足 C 规范，不满足应该报错。\n对于给定的 c_identifier 所有的声明应该有相同的类型签名。签名包括返回类型，参数的数量，顺序，方向，和类型。类型也包括了 array 的维度。签名还包括了 pure / context 标签，以及dpic_spec_string。\n在不同的 scope 是允许存在相同的声明的，因此参数名称和默认值可以不同。\n下面是一些例子：\n\n35.5.5 Function result\nimported 函数声明应该显式指定数据类型或者 void。函数返回类型被限制为 samll value。下面的 SV 数据类型可以作为返回类型：\n\nvoid, byte, shortint, int, longint, real, shortreal, chandle, string\nscalar values of type bit and logic\n\nexported 函数返回类型有相同的限制。\n35.5.6 Types of formal arguments\nSV 的数据类型很大的子集可以作为参数类型。通常，C 兼容类型，packed 类型，和基于这两种类型的用户定义类型都可以用于 DPI 的 subroutine。\n\n\n35.5.6.1 Open arrays\npacked 大小，unpakced 大小没有定义的还没涉及：这种情况属于 open array（unsized arrays）。open array 允许通用代码处理不同的大小。\nimported 函数的参数可以作为 open arrays（exported SV 函数不行）。\n\n35.6 Calling imported functions\n调用 imported 函数与 SV 函数是一样的。有默认参数的不能在调用中被省略，如果形参有名字，参数可以通过名字绑定。\n35.6.1 Argument passing\nimported 函数的参数传递依据 WYSIWYG 原则：What You Specify Is What You Get。形参的运算顺序参照 SV 规则。\n参数兼容性和强制转换规则也和 SV 一样。如果需要转换类型，会创建一个临时变量，然后作为实参传入。对于 input 和 inout 参数类型，临时变量使用实参的值来初始化。对于 output 或者 inout 参数，临时变量使用实参赋值。\nSV 侧的接口，input 参数的实参不会被被调影响。output 参数初始值未定义。imported 函数不应该修改 input 参数。\n对于 SV 侧的接口，参数传递的语义是：input 参数 copy-in，output 参数 copy-out，inout 参数 copy-in， copy-out。\n参数传递的实现对于 SV 是透明的。尤其是对于 SV 来说通过值传递还是引用传递是透明的。实参传递机制是外部语言定义的 layout。\n35.6.1.1 WYSIWYG principle\nWYSIWYG 原则保证了 imported 函数形参类型：实参保证符合形参的类型，除了 open arrays。除了 open arrays，形参完全由 import 声明定义。\n另一种说法是，没有编译器（C 或者 SV）可以在调用者声明的形参和被调者声明的形参之间强制转换。这是因为被调者形参声明的语言与调用者不同，因此两种形参是互相不可见的。\n35.6.2 Value changes for output and inout arguments\nSV 模拟器需要负责处理 output 和 inout 参数的修改。这种修改在 imported 函数完成回到 SV 代码之后应该是完成的。\n对于 output 和 inout 参数，值的传播（值修改事件）发生在 imported 函数返回后实参的值马上赋值给形参。如果有超过一个参数，赋值顺序参照 SV 的规则。\n35.7 Exported functions\nDPI 还允许 SV 函数被外部语言调用。但是，函数的限制与 imported 函数相同。通过声明为 exported 不改变 SV 函数的语义。\nSV exported 函数可以被外部语言调用，但是 export 的声明只在函数定义的 scope 有效。\n有一个重要限制，类的成员函数不能被 exported，其他所有函数都可以。\n声明格式在介绍 imported 函数一节已经描述过。所有的 exported 函数都是 context 函数。\n35.8 Exported tasks\nSV 允许外部函数调用 task。\n35.7 对于 exported 函数的都有描述都适用于 exported 任务。\n在 imported 函数中调用 exported 任务是不合法的，与 SV 自己的定义规则相同：在函数中调用任务不合法。\n只有在 context imported 任务中调用 exported 任务才合法。\nexported 的任务和函数的不同点在于 SV 任务没有返回值。任务的返回值是一个 int 值，表明禁用是否处于当前执行的线程。\n类似的，imported 任务返回 int 值用于表明 imported 任务关于禁用的知识。\n35.9 Disabling DPI tasks and functions\n可以使用 disable 语句使得 block 禁用当前正在执行混合语言调用链。当一个 DPI impor subroutine 被禁用，C 代码需要符合一个简单的禁用协议：使得 C 代码可以执行必要的资源清理，不如关闭打开的文件，关闭打开的 VPI handle，或者释放堆内存。\n当 disable 语句在设计目标或者父模块正在 diabling，imported subroutine 就处于禁止状态。imported subroutine 只会在调用 exported subroutine 返回之后进入禁止状态。协议的重要一点是禁止的 import 任务和函数应该在语义上了解自己被禁止了。subroutine 可以通过调用 svIsDisabledState()来了解是否被禁止。\n\nb，c，d 是 imported DPI 任务和函数的强制行为。DPI 开发者有责任正确实现这个行为。\na 由 SV 模拟器保证。并且模拟器应该也对 b，c，d 验证，如果没有满足应该报错。\n外部语言包含禁止协议，这个协议是用户代码与模拟器一起工作的。禁止协议允许外部模型参与模拟器的禁止处理。\n任务的特殊返回值没有改变 SV 代码的调用语法。export 任务的返回值由模拟器保证，import 任务的返回值由 DPI 应用保证。\nexported 任务本省是禁止的，但是其父 imported 任务不在禁止状态。\n当一个 DPI imported subroutine 由于禁用返回，output 和 inout 参数的值是未定义的。同时，函数的返回值也是未定义的。C 程序员可以从禁用函数返回，修改 output 和 inout 参数，但是 SV

k, ch(k, 1) 是 0，因为仅有一个桶。\nch(k, 2) 需要将一半 key 移动到新桶 1 中。\n...\nch(k, n + 1) 需要保持 ch(k, n) 中 $n/(n + 1)$ 的 key，然后移动 $1/(n + 1)$ 的 key 到桶 n 中\n\n所以每次需要对 $1/(n+1)$重新映射，才能使得映射均匀，那么接下来的问题就是：哪些 key 需要被重新映射？就是说增加新桶时，让哪些 key 到新桶中，哪些 key 保持不动？\n可以使用伪随机数（意味着，只要种子不变，随机序列就不变）来决定 k 每次是不是需要跳到新桶中，所以使用 k 作为随机数种子，就可以得到一个 k 的随机序列。为了保证桶数量从 $j$ 变到 $j + 1$时，有 $1/(j+1)$占比的数据跳到新桶 $j+1$。可以使用伪随机数归一化之后与 $1/(j+1)$比较决定 k 是不是需要跳到新桶，代码为：\nint ch(int key, int num_buckets) {\n    random.seed(key);\n    int b = 0; // this will track ch(key, j + 1)\n    for (int j = 1; j &lt; num_buckets; j++) {\n        if (random.next() &lt; 1.0 / (j + 1)) b = j;\n    }\n    return b;\n}\n\n\n本图是对这个函数的演绎。n 从1变化到5的过程中，$k_1$ 和 $k_2$ 每次都要根据随机序列与目标分布 $1/n$比较，来决定是留在原来桶还是移动到新桶。需要注意的是，一旦 k 确定，随机序列就确定。每次计算 ch 函数，for 循环就是在遍历一个确定的序列。所以，k 给定，n 确定，ch 的结果唯一确定，就可以保持 “一致”。\n举例，有三个 key：k1, k2, k3 ，随着桶数量增长的表格：\n1234567891011121314\nk100224444444444\nk201111117777777\nk3011115577710101010\n\n可以看到，对于确定 k 来说，随着桶数量增大，并不是每次都要跳到新桶中，这是算法的优化点。\n对于 ch 函数，$b$是记录 $k$的最后一次跳入的桶的编号。加入我们现在处于 $k$ 刚刚跳入$b$的时刻，一定有 $b + 1$个桶。接下来，我们要新增一个桶，变为 $b+2$时，易得 $k$不换桶的概率是 $(b+1)/(b+2)$。假设要找的下一个 $b$是 $j$，就是说，假设桶数量到了 $j+1$时，$k$跳入新桶，那么此期间，$k$保持不换桶的概率是\n$$P(stay_until_j) = \\frac{b+1}{b+2} \\times \\frac{b+2}{b+3} \\times ... \\times \\frac{j-1}{j} = \\frac{b+1}{j}$$\n\n虚线框表示不变桶，概率就是乘积。\n\n原文翻译：\n假设这个算法跟踪的是对于键 k 的桶序号的跳跃，假设 b 是最后一个 jump 的目标，表示 ch(k, b) != ch(k, b + 1)，并且 ch(k, b + 1) = b。现在，我们想要发现下一跳。最小的 j，使得 ch(k, j + 1) != ch(k, b + 1)，或者等效的，最大的 j 使得 ch(k, j) = ch(k, b + 1)。我们使用随机变量来分析 j。为了得到 j 的概率约束，注意到对于任意桶数量 i，我们有 j &gt;= i，当且仅当一致性哈希值不随 i 变化，等效为当且仅当 ch(k, i) = ch(k, b + 1)，因此 j 的分布满足\n$$P(j \\ge i) = P(ch(k,i) = ch(k, b + 1))$$\n幸运的是，这个分布很容易计算。因为 $P(ch(k,10)) = ch(k,11)$ 是 $10/11$，$P(ch(k,11)) = ch(k,12)$ 是 $11/12$，所以 $P(ch(k,10) = ch(k, 11))$ 是 $10/11 \\times 11/12 = 10/11$，推广，如果 $n \\ge m, P(ch(k,n) = ch(k,m)) = m / n$，因此对于任意 $i \\gt b$,\n$$P(j \\ge i) = P(ch(k,i) = ch(k, b + 1)) = (b + 1)/i$$\n现在，我们生成一个伪随机数，$r$， (依赖 k 和 j)，归一化到 0 到 1 之间。因为我们想要 $P(j \\ge i) = (b + 1)/i$，我们假设 $P(j \\ge i) iff r \\ge (b + 1)/i$。解决 $i$ 的不等式 $i / P(j \\ge i) iff i \\ge (b + 1)/r$，因为 $i \\ge j$，那么 j 等于 最大的 i ， 因此最大的 i 满足 $i \\ge (b+1)/r$，因此通过 floor 方法，$j = floor((b + 1)/r)。$\n使用这个公式，jump consistent hash 通过直到发现一个正数等于或者大于 num_buckets 来选择下一跳得到 ch(key, num_buckets)。然后我们知道上一跳就是结果\n\n改写 ch 函数：\nint ch(int k, int n) {\n  random.seed(k);\n  int b = 0, j = 0;\n  while (j &lt; n) {\n    if (random.next() &lt; (b+1.0)/j) b = j;\n    j += continuous_stays;\n  }\n  return b;\n} // 当符合连续不换桶的概率时，j 直接跳过\n\n假设 $r = random.next()$，要满足 $r \\lt (b+1)/j$，就必须 $j \\lt (b+1)/r$，就是说 $j$ 不能大于 $(b+1)/r$才不至于漏掉迭代，所以$j \\le (b+1)/r$，通过向下取整得到 j，进一步改写\nint ch(int key, int num_buckets) {\n    random.seed(key);\n    int b = -1;

 \n}\n\n因而在大部分情况下，java中使用Atomic包中的incrementAndGet的性能比用synchronized高出几倍。\n四、ABA问题\nthread1意图对val=1进行操作变成2，cas(val,1,2)。\nthread1先读取val=1；thread1被抢占（preempted），让thread2运行。\nthread2 修改val=3，又修改回1。\nthread1继续执行，发现期望值与“原值”（其实被修改过了）相同，完成CAS操作。\n使用CAS会造成ABA问题，特别是在使用指针操作一些并发数据结构时。\n解决方案\nABAʹ：添加额外的标记用来指示是否被修改。\n从Java1.5开始JDK的atomic包里提供了一个类AtomicStampedReference来解决ABA问题。这个类的compareAndSet方法作用是首先检查当前引用是否等于预期引用，并且当前标志是否等于预期标志，如果全部相等，则以原子方式将该引用和该标志的值设置为给定的更新值。\nCAS引发的两个问题\nCAS 操作包含三个操作数 —— 内存位置（V）、预期原值（A）和新值(B)。如果内存地址里面的值和A的值是一样的，那么就将内存里面的值更新成B。CAS是通过无限循环来获取数据的，若果在第一轮循环中，a线程获取地址里面的值被b线程修改了，那么a线程需要自旋，到下次循环才有可能机会执行。\n在JVM中的CAS操作就是基于处理器的CMPXCHG汇编指令实现的，因此，JVM中的CAS的原子性是处理器保障的。\nABA问题\nABA问题是指在CAS操作时，其他线程将变量值A改为了B，但是又被改回了A，等到本线程使用期望值A与当前变量进行比较时，发现变量A没有变，于是CAS就将A值进行了交换操作，但是实际上该值已经被其他线程改变过，这与乐观锁的设计思想不符合。ABA问题的解决思路是，每次变量更新的时候把变量的版本号加1，那么A-B-A就会变成A1-B2-A3，只要变量被某一线程修改过，改变量对应的版本号就会发生递增变化，从而解决了ABA问题。\nCAS自旋导致的开销\n多个线程争夺同一个资源时，如果自旋一直不成功，将会一直占用CPU。\n解决方法：破坏掉for死循环，当超过一定时间或者一定次数时，return退出。JDK8新增的LongAddr,和ConcurrentHashMap类似的方法。当多个线程竞争时，将粒度变小，将一个变量拆分为多个变量，达到多个线程访问多个资源的效果，最后再调用sum把它合起来。\n","id":"https://wendajiang.github.io/lock-free/","title":"无锁算法"},"https://wendajiang.github.io/memory-faq/":{"body":"\nlandley.net/writing/memory-faq.txt\nWhat is some existing documentation on Linux memory management?\nUlrich Drepper (the ex-glibc maintainer) wrote an article series called\n\"What every programmer should know about memory\":\nPart 1: http://lwn.net/Articles/250967/  (Introduction)\nPart 2: http://lwn.net/Articles/252125/  (CPU Cache)\nPart 3: http://lwn.net/Articles/253361/  (Virtual memory)\nPart 4: http://lwn.net/Articles/254445/  (NUMA systems)\nPart 5: http://lwn.net/Articles/255364/  (What programmers can do -- cache optimization)\nPart 6: http://lwn.net/Articles/256433/  (What programmers can do -- multi-threaded optimizations)\nPart 7: http://lwn.net/Articles/257209/  (Memory performance tools)\nPart 8: http://lwn.net/Articles/258154/  (Future technologies)\nPart 9: http://lwn.net/Articles/258188/  (Appendices and bibiography)\n\nMel Gorman's book \"Understanding the Linux Virtual Memory Manager\" is\navailable online:\nhttp://kernel.org/doc/gorman/\n\nWhat is virtual memory?\nVirtual memory provides a software-controlled set of memory addresses,\nallowing each process to have its own unique view of a computer's memory.\nVirtual addresses only make sense within a given context, such as a\nspecific process.  The same virtual address can simultaneously mean\ndifferent things in different contexts.\nVirtual addresses are the size of a CPU register.  On 32 bit systems each\nprocess has 4 gigabytes of virtual address space all to itself, which is\noften more memory than the system actually has.\nVirtual addresses are interpreted by a processor's Memory Management Unit\n(mmu), using data structures called page tables which map virtual address\nranges to associated content.\nVirtual memory is used to implement lazy allocation, swapping, file mapping,\ncopy on write shared memory, defragmentation, and more.\nFor details, see Ulrich Drepper's \"What every programmer should know\nabout memory, Part 3: Virtual Memory\":\nhttp://lwn.net/Articles/253361/\n\nWhat is physical memory?\nPhysical memory is storage hardware that records data with low latency and\nsmall granularity.  Physical memory addresses are numbers sent across a\nmemory bus to identify the specific memory cell within a piece of\nstorage hardware associated with a given read or write operation.\nExamples of storage hardware providing physical memory are DIMMs (DRAM),\nSD memory cards (flash), video cards (frame buffers and texture memory),\nnetwork cards (I/O buffers), and so on.\nOnly the kernel uses physical memory addresses directly.  Userspace\nprograms exclusively use virtual addresses.\nFor details, see the ARS Technica DRAM Guide:\n  http://arstechnica.com/paedia/r/ram_guide/ram_guide.part1-1.html\n  http://arstechnica.com/paedia/r/ram_guide/ram_guide.part2-1.html\n  http://arstechnica.com/paedia/r/ram_guide/ram_guide.part3-1.html\n\nAnd Ulrich Drepper's \"What every programmer should know about memory,\nPart 1\":\n  http://lwn.net/Articles/250967/\n\nWhat is a Memory Management Unit (MMU)?\nThe memory management unit is the part of the CPU that interprets virtual\naddresses.  Attempts to read, write, or execute memory at virtual addresses\nare either translated to corresponding physical addresses, or else\ngenerate an interrupt (page fault) to allow software to respond to the\nattempted access.\nThis gives each process its own virtual memory address range, which is\nlimited only by address space (4 gigabytes on most 32-bit system), while\nphysical memory is limited by the amount of available storage hardware.\nPhysical memory addresses are unique in the system, virtual memory addresses\nare unique per-process.\nWhat are page tables?\nPage tables are data structures which containing a process's list of memory\nmappings and track associated resources.  Each process has its own\nset of page tables, and the kernel also has a few page table entries for\nthings like disk cache.\n32-bit Linux systems use three-level tree structures to record page tables.\nThe levels are the Page Upper Directory (PUD), Page Middle Directory (PMD),\nand Page Table Entry (PTE).  (64-bit Linux can use 4-level page tables.)\nFor details, see:\n  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_table\n\nWhat are memory mappings?\nA memory mapping is a set of page table entries describing the properties\nof a consecutive virtual address range.  Each memory mapping has a\nstart address and length, permissions (such as whether the program can\nread, write, or execute from that memory), and associated resources (such\nas physical pages, swap pages, file contents, and so on).\nCreating new memory mappings allocates virtual memory, but not physical\nmemory (except for a small amount of physical memory needed to store the\npage table itself).  Physical pages are attached to memory mappings later,\nin response to page faults.  Physical memory is allocated on-demand by the\npage fault handler as necessary to resolve page faults.\nA page table can be thought of as a description of a set of memory\nmappings.  Each memory mapping can be anonymous, file backed, device backed,\nshared, or copy on write.\nThe mmap() system call adds a new memory mapping to the current process's\npage tables.  The munmap() system call discards an existing mapping.\nMemory mappings cannot overlap.  The mmap() call returns an error if asked\nto create overlapping memory mappings.\nVirtual address ranges for which there is no current memory mapping are said\nto be \"unmapped\", and attempts to access them generate a page fault which\ncannot be handled.  The page fault handler sends a Segmentation\nViolation signal (SIGSEGV) to the program on any access to unmapped\naddresses.  This is generally the result of following a \"wild pointer\".\nNote that by default, Linux intentionally leaves the first few kilobytes\n(or even megabytes) of each process's virtual address space unmapped, so\nthat attempts to dereference null pointers generate an unhandled page\nfault resulting in an immediate SIGSEGV, killing the process.\nFor details, see the Single Unix Specification version 4 entry for the\nmmap() system call:\nhttp://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/mmap.html\n\nAnd the glibc mmap() documentation:\nhttp://www.gnu.org/s/libc/manual/html_node/Memory_002dmapped-I_002fO.html\n\nWhat are shared pages?\nMultiple Page Table Entries can map the same physical page.  Access through\nthese virtual addresses (often in different processes) all show the same\ncontents, and changes to it are immediately visible to all users.  (Shared\nwritable mappings are a common high-performance inter-process communication\nmechanism.)\nThe number of PTEs mapping each physical page is tracked, and when the\nreference count falls to zero the page is moved to the free memory list.\nWhat is an anonymous mapping?\nAnonymous memory is a memory mapping with no file or device backing it.\nThis is how programs allocate memory from the operating system for use\nby things like the stack and heap.\nInitially, an anonymous mapping only allocates virtual memory.  The new\nmapping starts with a redundant copy on write mapping of the zero page.\n(The zero page is a single page of physical memory filled with zeroes,\nmaintained by the operating system.)  Every virtual page of the anonymous\nmapping is attached to this existing prezeroed page, so attempts to read\nfrom anywhere in the mapping return zeroed memory even though no new\nphysical memory has been allocated to it yet.\nAttempts to write to the page trigger the normal copy-on-write mechanism in\nthe page fault handler, allocating fresh memory only when needed to allow\nthe write to proceed.  (Note, prezeroing optimizations change the\nimplementation details here, but the theory's the same.)  Thus \"dirtying\"\nanonymous pages allocates physical memory, the actual allocation call only\nallocates virtual memory.\nDirty anonymous pages can be written to swap space, but in the absence of\nswap they remain \"pinned\" in physical memory.\nAnonymous mappings may be created by passing the MAP_ANONYMOUS flag to\nmmap().\nWhat is a file backed mapping?\nFile backed mappings mirror the contents of an existing file.  The mapping\nhas some administrative data noting which file to map from, and at which\noffset, as well as permission bits indicating whether the pages may be read,\nwritten, or executed.\nWhen page faults attach new physical pages to such a mapping, the contents of\nthose pages is initialized by reading the contents of the file being mapped,\nat the appropriate offset for that page.\nThese physical pages are usually shared with the page cache, the kernel's\ndisk cache of file contents.  The kernel caches the contents of files\nwhen the page is read, so sharing those cache pages with the process reduces\nthe total number of physical pages required by the system.\nWrites to file mappings created with the MAP_SHARED flag update the page\ncache pages, making the updated file contents immediately visible to other\nprocesses using the file, and eventually the cache pages will be flushed\nto disk updating the on-disk copy of the file.\nWrites to file mappings created with the MAP_PRIVATE flag perform a\ncopy on write, allocating a new local copy of the page to store the\nchanges.  These changes are not made visible to other processes, and do\nnot update the on-disk copy of the file.\nNote that this means writes to MAP_SHARED pages do not allocate additonal\nphysical pages (the page was already faulted into the page cache by the\nread, and the data can be flushed back to the file if the physical page\nis needed elsewhere), but writes to MAP_PRIVATE pages do (the copy in\nthe page cache and the local copy the program needs diverge, so two pages\nare needed to store them, and flushing the page cache copy back to disk\nwon't free up the local copy of the changed contents).\nWhat is the page cache?\nThe page cache is the kernel' cache of file contents.  It's the main\nuser of virtual memory that doesn't belong to a specific process.\nSee \"What is a file backed mapping\" and \"What is free memory\" for more info.\nWhat is CPU cache?\nThe CPU cache is a very small amount of very fast memory built into a\nprocessor, containing temporary copies of data to reduce processing latency.\nThe L1 cache is a tiny amount of memory (generally between 1k and 64k)\nwired directly into the processor that can be accessed in a single clock\ncycle.  The L2 cache is a larger amount of memory (up to several\nmegabytes) adjacent to the processor, which can be accessed in a small\nnumber of clock cycles.  Access to uncached memory (across the memory bus)\ncan take dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of clock cycles.\n(Note that latency is the issue CPU cache addresses, not throughput.  The\nmemory bus can provide a constant stream of memory, but takes a while to\nstart doing so.)\nFor details, see Ulrich Drepper's \"What every programmer should know\nabout memory, Part 2\":\n  http://lwn.net/Articles/252125/\n\nWhat is a Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB)?\nThe TLB is a cache for the MMU.  All memory in the CPU's L1 cache must\nhave an associated TLB entry, and invalidating a TLB entry flushes the\nassociated cache line(s).\nThe TLB is a small fixed-size array of recently used pages, which the\nCPU checks on each memory access.  It lists a few of the virtual address\nranges to which physical pages are currently assigned.\nAccesses to virtual addresses listed in the TLB go directly through to the\nassociated physical memory (or cache pages) without generating page faults\n(assuming the page permissions allow that category of access).  Accesses\nto virtual addresses not listed in the TLB (a \"TLB miss\") trigger a page\ntable lookup, which is performed either by hardware, or by the page fault\nhandler, depending on processor type.\nFor details, see: \n  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_lookaside_buffer\n\n1995 interview with Linus Torvalds describing the i386, PPC, and Alpha TLBs:\n  http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/36\n\nWhat is a page fault handler?\nA page fault handler is an interrupt routine, called by the Memory\nManagement Unit in response an attempt to access virtual memory which\ndid not immediately succeed.\nWhen a program attempts to read, write, or execute memory in a page that\nhasn't got the appropriate permission bits set in its page table entry\nto allow that type of access, the instruction generates an interrupt.  This\ncalls the page fault handler to examines the registers and page tables of\nthe interrupted process and determine what action to take to handle\nthe fault.\nThe page fault handler may respond to a page fault in three ways:\n\n\nThe page fault handler can resolve the fault by immediately attaching a\npage of physical memory to the appropriate page table entry, adjusting\nthe entry, and resuming the interrupted instruction.  This is called a\n\"soft fault\".\n\n\nWhen the fault handler can't immediately resolve the fault, it may\nsuspend the interrupted process and switch to another while the system\nworks to resolve the issue.  This is called a \"hard fault\", and results\nwhen an I/O operation most be performed to prepare the physical page\nneeded to resolve the fault.\n\n\nIf the page fault handler can't resolve the fault, it sends a signal\n(SIGSEGV) to the process, informing it of the failure.  Although a process\ncan install a SIGSEGV handler (debuggers and emulators tend to do this),\nthe default behavior of an unhandled SIGSEGV is to kill the process with\nthe message \"bus error\".\n\n\nA page fault that occurs in an interrupt handler is called a \"double fault\",\nand usually panics the kernel.  The double fault handler calls the kernel's\npanic() function to print error messages to help diagnose the problem.\nThe process to be killed for accessing memory it shouldn't is the\nkernel itself, and thus the system is too confused to continue.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_fault\n\nA triple fault cannot be handled in software.  If a page fault occurrs in\nthe double fault handler, the machine immediately reboots.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_fault\n\nHow does the page fault handler allocate physical memory?\nThe Linux kernel uses lazy (on-demand) allocation of physical pages,\ndeferring the allocation until necessary and avoiding allocating physical\npages which will never actually be used.\nMemory mappings generally start out with no physical pages attached.  They\ndefine virtual address ranges without any associated physical memory.  So\nmalloc() and similar allocate space, but the actual memory is allocated\nlater by the page fault handler.\nVirtual pages with no associated physical page will have the read,\nwrite, and execute bits disabled in their page table entries.  This causes\nany access to that address to generate a page fault, interrupting the\nprogram and calling the page fault handler.\nWhen the page fault handler needs to allocate physical memory to handle\na page fault, it zeroes a free physical page (or grabs a page from a pool\nof prezeroed pages), attaches that page of memory to the Page Table Entry\nassociated with the fault, updates that PTE to allow the appropriate access,\nand resumes the faulting instruction.\nNote that implementing this requires two sets of page table flags for\nread, write, execute, and share.  The VM_READ, VM_WRITE, VM_EXEC, and\nVM_SHARED flags (in linux/mm.h) are used by the MMU to generate faults.\nThe VM_MAYREAD, VM_MAYWRITE, VM_MAYEXEC, and VM_MAYSHARE flags are used by\nthe page fault handler to determine whether the attempted access was legal\nand thus the fault handler should adjust the PTE to resolve the fault and\nallow the process to continue.\nHow does fork work?\nThe fork() system call creates a new process by copying an existing\nprocess.  A new process is created with a copy of the page tables\nthat calls fork().  These page tables are all copy on write mappings\nsharing the existing physical pages between parent and child.\nHow does exec work?\nThe exec() system call executes a new file in the current process\ncontext.  It blanks the process's current page table, discarding all\nexisting mappings, and replaces them with a fresh page table containing\na small number of new mappings, including an executable mmap() of the new\nfile passed to the exec() call, a small amount of administrative space\ncontaining the environment variables and command line arguments passed\ninto the new program, a new process stack, and so on.\nThe normal way to launch a new process in Unix-like systems is to call\nfork(), followed immediately by a call to exec() in the new process.\nThus fork() copies the parent process's existing process's memory mappings\ninto the new process, then exec() immediately discards them again.\nBecause these were shared mappings, the fork() allocates a lot of virtual\nspace but consumes very few new physical pages.\nHow do shared libraries work?\nOnly statically linked executables are executed directly.  Shared libraries\nare executed by the dynamic linker (either ld-linux.so.2 or ld-uClibc.so.0),\nwhich despite the name is a statically linked executable that works a bit\nlike #!/bin/sh or #!usr/bin/perl in shell scripts.  It's the binary that's\nlaunched to run this program, and the path to this program is fed to it as\nits first argument.\nThe dynamic linker mmap()s the executable files, and any shared libraries\nit needs, using the MAP_PRIVATE flag.  This allows it to write to those\npages to perform the dynamic linking fixups allowing the executable's calls\nout to the shared library code to connect.  (It calls mprotect() to set the\npages read only before handing control over to the linked executable.)\nThe dynamic linker traces through various lists of calls in the program's\nELF tables, looks up the appropriate function pointer for each one, and\nwrites that pointer to the call site in the memory mapping.\nPages the dynamic linker writes to are essentially converted to anonymous\npages by breaking the copy-on-write.  These new \"dirtied\" pages allocate\nphysical memory visible only to this process.  Thus keeping to a minimum\nthe number of dirtied pages allows the rest to remain shared, and thus saves\nmemory.\nShared libraries are normally compiled with the -fpic flag (Position\nIndependent Code), which creates an object table containing all the\nreferences to external calls to data and functions.  Instead of reaching\nout and touching the shared objects directly, the code bounces off this\ntable.  This makes the code slightly larger by inserting an extra jump\nor extra load, but the advantage is that all the external references\nmodified by the linker are grouped together into a small number of pages.\nSo the binary is slightly larger, but more of the pages are shared since\nthe number of physical pages dirtied by the dynamic linker is smaller each\ntime the shared object is used.\nNormally only shared libraries are compiled this way, but some programs\n(such as busybox) which the system expects to run many instances of may\nalso benefit from the increased sharing more than they suffer from the\nincreased size.\nNote that statically linked programs have no fixups applied to them, and\nthus no private executable pages.  Every page of their executable mapping\nremains shared.  They also spawn faster, since there's no dynamic linker\nperforming fixups.  Thus in some circumstances, static linking is actually\nmore efficient than dynamic linking.  (Strange but true.)\nHow does copy on write work?\nIf two page table entries point to the same physical page, the contents\nof that page show up in both locations when read.  A reference counter\nassociated with the page tracks how many page table entries point to that\npage.  Each of those page table entries has read permission (but not\nwrite permissions) for the page.\nAttemps to write to the page generate a page fault.  The page fault handler\nallocates a new physical page, copies the contents of the shared page into\nthe new page, attaches the new page to the faulting page table entry, sets\nthe updated PTE writeable, decrements the count on the old shared page\n(possibly removing its shared status if the reference count falls to 1),\nand resumes the faulting process allowing the write to go through to the\nnew nonshared copy of the page.\nThis is a form of lazy allocation, deferring memory allocation until\nthe new memory is actually used.\nWhat are clean pages?\nClean pages have copies of their data stored elsewhere, such as in swap\nspace or in a file.  Thus the physical memory storing that information may\nbe reclaimed an reused elsewhere by detaching the physical page from the\nassociated Page Table Entry.  When the page's contents are needed again,\na new physical page may be allocated and its contents read from the stored\ncopy.\nWhat are active pages?\nActive pages are page table entries that have associated physical pages\nwhich have been used recently.\nThe system can track active pages by removing the read, write, and execute\nbits from page table entries but leaving the associated physical page\nstill attached, then taking a soft fault the next time that page is\naccessed.  The fault handler can cheaply switch the appropriate access\nbit back on and resume the faulting instruction, thereby recording that\nthe page is currently in use.\nPages which are active are poor candidates for page stealing, even if\nthey are clean, because the process using them will quickly fault a new\nphysical page back in again if the current one is reclaimed.\nNote that reading a lot of filesystem data marks cache pages as active,\nsince they're recently used.  This not only causes the page cache to\nallocate lots of physical pages, but prevents those pages from being\nreclaimed since they were used more recently than other pages in the\nsystem.\nWhat are free pages?\nWhen a page's reference count goes to zero, the page is added to the free\nlist inside the kernel.  These free pages are not currently used for any\npurpose, and are essentially wasted until some use is found for them.\nA freshly booted system starts with lots of free pages.  Free pages also\noccur when processes exit(), or when munmap() discards a mapping and the\nprivate pages associated with it.\nThe kernel tries to minimize the number of free pages in the system.\nInstead, it tries to find uses for these pages which improve performance of\nexisting processes, but which leaves them easily reclaimable if the memory\nis needed for another purpose.\nFor example, the page cache keeps around copies of file contents long\nafter they were last accessed, potentially avoiding an expensive disk\naccess if that file is read again in future.  If those pages are needed\nfor other purposes, the cached contents can easily be discarded and the\npages reallocated.\nWhat is page stealing?\nPage stealing is a response to a shortage of free pages, by \"stealing\"\nexisting allocated physical pages from their current users.  It's a\nstatistical method of effectively obtaining extra physical pages by\nidentifying existing allocations unlikely to be used again in the\nnear future and recycling them.\nPage stealing removes existing physical pages from their mappings, disposes\nof their current contents (often by writing them to disk), and reuses the\nmemory elsewhere.  If the original user needs their page back, a new\nphysical page is allocated and the old contents loaded into the new page.\nPage stealing looks for inactive pages, since active ones would probably\njust be faulted back in again immediately.  Clean inactive pages are almost\nas good as free pages, because their current contents are already copied\nsomewhere else and can be discarded without even performing any I/O.\nDirty pages are cleaned by scheduling I/O to write them to backing store\n(swap for anonymous pages, to the mapped file for shared file backed\nmappings).\nPage stealing attempts to determine which existing physical pages are least\nlikely to be needed again soon, meaning its trying to predict the future\nactions of the processes using those pages.  It does so through various\nheuristics, which can never be perfect.\nWhat is a \"working set\" of pages?\nA working set is the set of memory chunks required to complete an\noperation.  For example, the CPU attempts to keep the set of cache\nlines required for tight inner loops in L1 cache until the loop completes.\nIt attempts to keep the set of frequently used functions from various\nparts of a program (including shared libraries) in the L2 cache.  It does\nso both by prefetching cache lines it predicts it may need soon, and by\nmaking decisions about which cache lines to discard and which to keep when\nmaking space to load new cache lines.\nThe page fault handler attempts to keep each currently running process's\nworking set of pages in physical memory until the process blocks awaiting\ninput or exits.  Unused portions of program code may never even be loaded\non a given program run (such as an \"options\" menu for a program that isn't\ncurrently being configured, or portions of generic shared libraries which\nthis program doesn't actually use).\nThe working set is determined dynamically at runtime, and can change\nover time as a program does different things.\nThe objective of page stealing is to keep the \"working set\" of pages in\nfast physical memory, allowing processes to \"race to quiescence\" where\nthe system completes its current tasks quickly and settles down into\nan idle state waiting for the next thing to do.  From this point of view,\nphysical memory can be seen as a cache both for swap pages and for\nexecutables in the filesystem.  The task of keeping the working set in\nphysical memory (and avoiding page faults that trigger I/O) is analogous\nto the CPU's task of keeping the appropriate contents in L1 and L2 caches.\nWhat is thrashing?\nIn low memory situations, each new allocation involves stealing an in-use\npage from elsewhere, saving its current contents, and loading new contents.\nWhen that page is again referenced, another page must be stolen to replace\nit, saving the new contents and reloading the old contents.\nIt essentially means that the working set required to service the main\nloops of the programs the system is running are larger than available\nphysical memory, either because physical memory is tied up doing something\nelse or because the working set is just that big.\nThis can lead to a state where the CPU generates a constant stream of\npage faults, and spends most of its time sitting idle, waiting for I/O to\nservice those page faults.\nThis is often called \"swap thrashing\", and in some ways is the result of\na failure of the system's swap file.\nIf the swap file is too small (or entirely absent), the system can only\nsteal pages from file backed mappings.  Since every executable program\nand shared library is a file backed mapping, this means the system yanks\nexecutable pages, which is generally faults back in fairly rapidly since\nthey tend to get used a lot.  This can quickly lead to thrasing.\nThe other way to encourage swap thrashing is by having too large of a swap\nfile, so that programs that query available memory see huge amounts of swap\nspace and try to use it.  The system's available physical memory and I/O\nbandwidth don't change with the size of the swap file, so attempts to use\nany significant portion of that swap space result memory accesses occuring at\ndisk I/O speed (four orders of magnitude slower than main memory, stretching\neach 1/10th of a second out to about two minutes).\nWhat is the Out Of Memory (OOM) killer?\nIf the system ever truly ran out of physical memory, it could reach a state\nwhere every process is waiting for some other process to release a page\nbefore it could continue.  This deadlock situation would freeze the system.\nBefore this happened, the system would start thrashing, where it would\nslow itself to a crawl by spending all its time constantly stealing pages\nonly to steal them back again immediately.  This situation is almost as\nbad as true deadlock, slowing response time to useless levels (five or ten\nminute latency on normally instantaneous responses is not unusual during\nswap thrashing; this is assuming your operation does not time out instead).\nA system that enters swap thrashing may take hours to recover (assuming\na backlog of demands does not emerge as it fails to service them, preventing\nit from ever recovering).  Or it can take just as long to proceed to\na true deadlock (where the flood of swap I/O stops because the CPU is pegged\nat 100% searching for the next page to steal, never finding one, and thus\nstops scheduling new I/O).\nTo avoid either situation, Linux introduced the OOM killer.  When it\ndetects the system has entered swap thrashing, it heuristically determines\na process to kill to free up pages.  It can also be configured to reboot\nthe entire system instead of selecting a specific process to kill.\nThe OOM killer's process-killing capability is a reasonable way to deal with\nrunaway processes and \"fork bombs\", but in the absence of a clearly\nmalfunctioning process that is truly \"at fault\", killing any process is\noften unacceptable.\nNote that the OOM killer doesn't wait for a true memory exhaustion to\ndeadlock the system, both because the system is effectively down while\nthrashing, and because a paralyzed system might not be able to run even\nthe OOM killer.\nThe OOM killer's process killing heuristics are a reasonable way to deal with\nrunaway processes and \"fork bombs\", but in the absence of a clearly\nmalfunctioning process that is truly \"at fault\", killing any process is\noften unacceptable.  Developers often argue about the choice of processes\nto kill, and exactly when the thrashing is bad enough to trigger the OOM\nkiller and when to allow the system to attempt to work its way through\nto recovery.  Both of these heuristics are by their nature imperfect,\nbecause they attempt to predict the future.\nIn general, developers try to avoid triggering the OOM killer, and treat\nits occurrence as the userspace equivalent of a kernel panic().  The system\ngot into an untenable state, it might be good to find out why and prevent\nits recurrence.\nWhy is \"strict overcommit\" a dumb idea?\nPeople who don't understand how virtual memory works often insist on\ntracking the relationship between virtual and physical memory, and attempting\nto enforce some correspondence between them (when there isn't one), instead\nof controlling their programs' behavior.\nMany common unix programming idioms create large virtual memory\nranges with the potential to consume a lot of physical memory, but\nnever realize that potential.  Linux allows the system to \"overcommit\"\nmemory, creating memory mappings that promise more physical memory than\nthe system could actually deliver.\nFor example, the fork/exec combo creates transient virtual memory usage\nspikes, which go away again almost immediately without ever breaking the\ncopy on write status of most of the pages in the forked page tables.  Thus\nif a large process forks off a smaller process, enormous physical memory\ndemands threaten to happen (as far as overcommit is concerned), but never\nmaterialize.\nDynamic linking raises similar issues: the dynamic linker maps executable\nfiles and shared libraries MAP_PRIVATE, which allows it to write to those\npages to perform the dynamic linking fixups allowing the shared library\ncalls to connect to the shared library.  In theory, there could be a\ncall to functions or data in a shared library within every page of the\nexecutable (and thus the entire mapping could be converted to anonymous\nmemory by the copy on write actions of the dynamic linker).  And since\nshared libraries can call other shared libraries, those could require\nprivate physical memory for their entire mapping too.\nIn reality, that doesn't happen.  It would be incredibly inefficient and\ndefeat the purpose of using shared libraries in the first place.  Most\nshared libraries are compiled as Position Independent Code (PIC), and\nsome executables are Position Independent Executalbles (PIE), which\ngroups \nPeople who don't understand how virtual memory works often insist on\ntracking the relationship between virtual and physical memory, and attempting\nto enforce some correspondence between them (when there isn't one).  Instead\nof designing their programs with predictable and controllable behavior, they\ntry to make the operating system predict the future.  This doesn't work.\nStrict overcommit encourages the addition of gigabytes (even terabytes)\nof swap space, which leads to swap thrasing if it is ever used.  Systems\nwith large amounts of swap space can literally thrash for days, during which\nthey perform less computation than they could perform in a single minute\nduring non-thrashing operation (such as if the OOM killer triggered a\nreboot).\nWhat is the appeal of huge pages?\nThe CPU has a limited number of TLB entries.  A huge page allows a single TLB\nentry to translate addresses for a large amount of contiguous physical\nmemory.  (For example, the entire Linux kernel fits within a single 2\nmegabyte \"huge page\" on x86 systems.  Keeping the entire kernel in a\nsingle TLB entry means that calling into the kernel doesn't flush the\nuserspace mappings out of the TLB.)\nUsing huge pages means the MMU spends less time walking page tables to refill\nthe TLB, and can lead to about a 10% performance increase if used\ncorrectly.\nWhat are memory zones and \"high memory\"?\nhttp://kerneltrap.org/node/2450\nhttp://linux-mm.org/HighMemory\nhttp://www.cs.columbia.edu/~smb/classes/s06-4118/l19.pdf\nhttp://book.opensourceproject.org.cn/kernel/kernelpri/opensource/0131181637/ch04lev1sec2.html\n","id":"https://wendajiang.github.io/memory-faq/","title":"Memory Faq(landley.net)"},"https://wendajiang.github.io/mysql-transaction/":{"body":"这篇文章属于转载，原链接 https://draveness.me/mysql-transaction/\n原链接作者如要求删除，请联系 wendajiang1993@gmail.com\n在关系型数据库中，事务的重要性不言而喻，只要对数据库稍有了解的人都知道事务具有 ACID 四个基本属性。\nACID\n\nAtomicity\nConsistency\nIsolation\nDurability\n\n事务其实就是并发控制的基本单位：相信我们都知道，事务是一个序列操作，要么都执行，要么都不执行，是不可分割的。数据库事务的 ACID 四大特性是事务的基础。\nAtomicity 原子性\n要保证事务的原子性，就需要在异常发生时，对已经执行的操作进行回滚，而在 MySQL 中，恢复机制是通过回滚日志（undo log）实现的，所有事务进行的修改都会记录到这个回滚日志中，然后在对应数据库中进行写入。\n  graph LR\n\tsubgraph SQL1\n\tA(Undo Log) -.-&gt;

B(\"DELETE FROM users where id = 1\")\n\tC(\"UPDATE users SET name='dravenss' WHERE id = 1\") --&gt; D(\"UPDATE users SET name='draven' WHERE id = 1\")\n\n在这里，我们并不会介绍回滚日志的格式以及它是如何被管理的，本文重点关注在它到底是一个什么样的东西，究竟解决了、如何解决了什么样的问题，如果想要了解具体实现细节，需要进一步学习 @todo\n事务的状态\n因为事务具有原子性，是一个密不可分的整体，事物的状态也有三种 Active,Commited,Failed，事务要不在执行中，要不就是成功或者失败\n  flowchart LR\n\tB((Active)) --&gt; A((Commited))\n\tB --&gt; C((Failed))\n\n但是放大来看，事务不在是原子的，其中包括了很多中间状态，比如部分提交，事务的状态图也变得越来越复杂。\n  flowchart LR\n\tA((Active))\n\tB((Partially))\n\tC((Failed))\n\tD((Commited))\n\tE((Aborted))\n\tA --&gt;

C[Low Performance]\n\n展示各个隔离级别对于脏读，不可重复读，幻读的解决情况：\n\n隔离级别的实现\n数据库对于隔离级别的实现就是使用并发控制机制对在同一时间执行的事务进行控制，限制不同的事务对于同一资源的访问和更新，而最重要也最常见的并发控制机制，在这里我们将简单介绍三种最重要的并发控制器机制的工作原理。\n锁\n锁是一种最为常见的并发控制机制，在一个事务中，我们并不会将整个数据库都加锁，而是只会锁住那些需要访问的数据项， MySQL 和常见数据库中的锁都分为两种，共享锁（Shared）和互斥锁（Exclusive），前者也叫读锁，后者叫写锁\n读锁保证了读操作可以并发执行，相互不受影响，写锁保证了在更新数据库数据时不会有其他事务访问或者更改同一条记录造成不可预知的情况\n时间戳\n除了锁，另一种实现事务的隔离性的方式就是通过时间戳，使用这种方式实现事务的数据库，例如 PostgreSQL 会为每一条记录保留两个字段；读时间戳中包括了所有访问该记录的事务中的最大时间戳，而记录行的写时间戳中保存了将记录改到当前值的事务的时间戳。\n记录行的结构\nDataRead TimstampWrite Timestamp\n\n使用时间戳实现事务的隔离性时，往往都会使用乐观锁，先对数据进行修改，在写回时再去判断当前值，也就是时间戳是否改变过，如果没有改变过，就写入，否则，生成一个新的时间戳并再次更新数据，乐观锁其实并不是真正的锁机制，它只是一种思想，在这里并不会对它进行展开介绍\n多版本和快照隔离\n通过维护多个版本的数据，数据库可以允许事务在数据被其他事务更新时对旧版本的数据进行读取，很多数据库都对这一机制进行了实现；因为所有的读操作不再需要等待写锁的释放，所以能够显著地提升读的性能，MySQL 和 PostgreSQL 都对这一机制进行自己的实现，也就是 MVCC，虽然各自实现的方式有所不同，MySQL 就通过文章中提到的回滚日志实现了 MVCC，保证事务并行执行时能够不等待互斥锁的释放直接获取数据。\n隔离性和原子性\n简单提一下在原子性里面提到的级联回滚，如果一个事务对数据进行了写入，就会获取一个互斥锁，其他事务想要获取该行数据的读锁就必须等待写锁的释放，就不会发生级联回滚的问题。\n不过在大多数的数据库，比如 MySQL 中都使用了 MVCC 等特性，也就是正常的读方法是不需要获取锁的，在想要对读取的数据进行更新时需要使用 SELECT ... FOR UPDATE 尝试获取对应行的互斥锁，以保证不同事务可以正常工作。\nConsistency 一致性\n两个一致性 ACID ， CAP\n数据库对于 ACID 中的一致性的定义是这样的：如果一个事务原子地在一个一致地数据库中独立运行，那么在它执行之后，数据库的状态一定是一致的。对于这个概念，它的第一层意思就是对于数据完整性的约束，包括主键约束、引用约束以及一些约束检查等等，在事务的执行的前后以及过程中不会违背对数据完整性的约束，所有对数据库写入的操作都应该是合法的，并不能产生不合法的数据状态。\n而第二层意思其实是指逻辑上的对于开发者的要求，我们要在代码中写出正确的事务逻辑，比如银行转账，事务中的逻辑不可能只扣钱或者只加钱，这是应用层面上对于数据库一致性的要求。\n数据库 ACID 中的一致性对事务的要求不止包含对数据完整性以及合法性的检查，还包含应用层面逻辑的正确。\n\nCAP 定理中的数据一致性，其实是说分布式系统中的各个节点中对于同一数据的拷贝有着相同的值；而 ACID 中的一致性是指数据库的规则，如果 schema 中规定了一个值必须是唯一的，那么一致的系统必须确保在所有的操作中，该值都是唯一的，由此来看 CAP 和 ACID 对于一致性的定义有着根本性的区别\n总结\n事务的 ACID 四大基本特性是保证数据库能够运行的基石，但是完全保证数据库的 ACID，尤其是隔离性会对性能有比较大影响，在实际的使用中我们也会根据业务的需求对隔离性进行调整，除了隔离性，数据库的原子性和持久性相信都是比较好理解的特性，前者保证数据库的事务要么全部执行、要么全部不执行，后者保证了对数据库的写入都是持久存储的、非易失的，而一致性不仅是数据库对本身数据的完整性的要求，同时也对开发者提出了要求 - 写出逻辑正确并且合理的事务。\n最后，也是最重要的，当别人在讲一致性的时候，一定要搞清楚他的上下文\n","id":"https://wendajiang.github.io/mysql-transaction/","title":"mysql_transaction"},"https://wendajiang.github.io/namespace-learn/":{"body":"\n基本使用\n\nnamespace

PaxosStore，一种支持微信综合业务的高可用存储系统。在存储层使用了组合设计利用多种存储引擎来适配不通的存储模型。PaxosStore 使用 Paxos 共识协议作为中间层，统一了对于底层多个存储引擎的访问。这有助于调整、维护，以及对于存储系统的扩缩容。根据我们在工程实践中的经验，在实际中实现一套可用的一致性读写协议比理论上要复杂很多。为了克服工程的复杂性，我们提出了 Paxos-based 存储的多层协议栈，其中 PaxosLog，协议中的关键数据结构，被设计为桥接从面向程序的一致性读写到面向存储的 Paxos 过程。此外，我们还提供了基于 Paxos 的优化，可以更有效的具备容错能力。本文讨论主要侧重务实的解决方案，这可能是构建分布式存储系统的关键。\n1. 介绍 (Introduction)\n微信是最受欢迎的移动应用之一，每天拥有 7 亿活跃用户。由微信提供的服务包括 IM，社交网络，移动支付，第三方授权等。各种微信的后端服务由不同的团队开发。尽管业务逻辑的多样性，大多数后端组件需要可靠的存储来支撑。最开始每个开发团队随机选择现成的存储方案来实现原型。然而，在生产系统中，各种碎片化的存储系统维护成本极高，而且难以扩展。这种现状呼吁着一个通用的存储系统提供个各种微信业务使用，而 PaxosStore 就是微信的第二代存储系统\n这个存储服务需要满足以下要求。首先，大数据的 3 大 V（volume，velocity，variety）是存在的。每天平均产生 1.5TB 的数据，其中包含各种类型的内容，包括文本消息，图像，音频，视频，财务交易，社交网站帖子等。白天的应用的查询速率达到每秒万条。尤其是，单记录访问占主要使用情况。其次，高可用在存储服务中必须是一等公民。大多数服务依赖 PaxosStore（比如，点对点消息，群消息，浏览社交网络帖子等）。可用性对于用户体验是至关重要的。微信的大多数应用要求 PaxosStore 的延迟小于 20ms。而且跨城市的访问也要有这种延迟要求。\n除了建设 PaxosStore 提供高可用服务，还面临以下挑战:\n\n有效性和高效的共识保证。   PaxosStore 核心上使用 Paxos 算法达成共识。尽管理论上的 Paxos 算法提供了共识保证，但是实现的复杂性（例如需要维护复杂的状态机）以及运行时的开销（例如同步的带宽）使其不足以全面支持微信的服务\n弹性以及低延迟。   PaxosStore 要求在城市规模提供低延迟的读写。在运行时需要支撑巨大的负载\n自动跨数据中心的容错能力。   在微信的生产环境，PaxosStore 全球跨数据中心部署了成千上百的服务器。在这种大规模系统中，硬件故障和网络中断并不罕见。容错能力要求快速的故障检测和不影响系统的恢复。\n\nPaxosStore 设计并实施为微信后端高可用性存储的解决方案。在存储层中采用组合设计，接入了不同的存储引擎来适应不同的存储模型。PaxosStore 使用 Paxos 共识协议作为中间层统一了对于底层存储引擎的访问。Paxos-based 的存储协议可扩展支持各种暴露于应用程序的数据结构。此外，PaxosStore 采用 leaseless design（译者注:无租约），这有利于改善系统的可用性以及容错能力。\n论文的主要贡献如下:\n\n我们介绍了 PaxosStore 的设计，重点阐述了一致性读写协议的构建及其运作方式。通过从存储层中解耦出一致性协议，PaxosStore 拥有很好的可扩展性，可以给为不同存储模型构建的多种存储引擎提供支持。\n根据 PaxosStore 的设计，我们进一步论述了容错系统以及关于数据恢复的细节。   文中描述的技术已在大型生产环境中实现了全面应用，它们使 PaxosStore 在微信所有的生产应用中达到了 99.9999% 的可用性（此结果是通过对 6 个月的运行数据进行统计得出的）。\n在日益成长的微信业务背后， PaxosStore 已经为其提供了两年多的支持。基于这些实践经验，我们探讨了 PaxosStore 设计上的取舍，并给出了我们的应用实践所得到的实验评估结果。\n\n文章剩余的内容组织如下。首先在第二节详细阐述了设计细节和 PaxosStore 的架构，然后在第三节描述了容错系统和数据恢复技术。在第四节讨论 PaxosStore 的实现关键点。在第五节，对 PaxosStore 进行了性能测试并收集了运行系统中的数据来展示。在第六节讨论了相关研究，最后第七节总结了本文以及在构建 PaxosSore 系统的得到的经验。\n2. 设计 (Design)\n2.1 架构 (Overall Architecture)\n\n图 1 说明了 PaxosStore 的总体体系结构，该架构包含了三层。编程模型层提供了暴露给应用的各种数据结构，共识层实现了 Paxos-based 存储协议，存储层包含了基于不同存储模型的不同存储引擎，以使不同数据结构的性能最大化。PaxosStore 不同于传统存储系统主要在于将中间层的共识协议解耦出来，为底层多种数据引擎提供共识保证。\n传统的分布式存储系统通常为了一种数据模型单独构建，并调整设计和实现以满足各种应用需求。然而，这就需要不同组件的各种复杂权衡。尽管组装多个现成的存储系统来满足存储要求的多样性也可以，但是这通常使整个系统难以维护而且不容易扩展。此外，每个存储系统将共识模型与存储模型耦合在一起，然后拼凑起来的组合系统分而治之结果可能使共识结果是错误的，因为每个单独的存储子系统各自保持共识。此外，使用多种数据模型的应用（会使用多个存储子系统）很难利用底层的子系统的共识保证，从而不得不自己单独实现一套自己的共识协议。\n因为编程模型层的设计和实现在工程上并不难，所以主要表述了 PaxosStore 共识层和存储层设计\n2.2 共识层 (Consensus Layer)\n\n协议栈三层如图 2 所示\n2.2.1 Paxos\n存储协议基于 Paxos 算法使数据在多个 node 之间同步。理论上，Paxos 包含了两个阶段:准备阶段来达成准备工作的一致，接受阶段来达成最终的一致。按照惯例，Paxos 使用状态机表述。但是过度的状态设计以及复杂的状态转移会使得运行时很低的性能。\n在 PaxosStore 中，我们摒弃了状态机的方式，而是使用半对称消息传递来解释 Paxos 过程。为此，我们首先定义一些符号\n此节先略\n2.2.2 PaxosLog\nPaxosLog 在 PaxosStore 中作为数据更新的 write-ahead log。图 3 展现了数据结构，每个 log entry 由 Paxos 算法决定，可以被一个不变的序列号索引--entry ID，唯一递增。最大的 entry ID 表示版本。\n\n概念上，PaxosLog 实例可以被无限生成。实际上，通过 LRU 策略，异步删除过时的 log entries。除了数据 value 之外，每个 PaxosLog 包含 Paxos 关联的元数据，promise number m 和 proposal number n, 在 2.2.1 节中的 Paxos 算法使用，但是一旦 log entry 完成就会被丢弃（蓝色线框标记出）。此外，由于同一数据的多个副本主机可能同时发出写入请求，但是只有一个请求会被接受，proposer ID 附加到被选中的 value 上表明 value 的 proposer。Proposer ID 是 32 位的机器 ID，数据中心中唯一表征一个 node。用于预准备阶段的优化，如果当前写入可以跳过 pre-pare/promise 阶段，如果与上次写入的相同请求的原点，则符合写请求的局部性。此外，request ID 唯一标志与 value 相关联的写请求。用于防止重复写入（详细讨论在 3.3）。特别的，request ID 包含了三个部分:32 位的 client ID（比如 IPv4 地址）表明提出写请求的客户端，16 位的时间戳表明客户端本地时间，16 位的序列号表明客户端请求序列区分同一秒的请求\n根据 write-ahead log 对于数据更新的机制，PaxosLog entry 在将值写入到存储引擎中时必须被处理。通常，PaxosLog 存储和数据对象存储是分离的，如图 4 所示，一次数据更新，两次有序的写 I/O :一次写 PaxosLog entry，接下来更新数据对象\n\nPaxosLog 对于 Key-Value 数据的使用。  考虑下 k-v 存储，我们有两种优化，简化了 paxoslog 的构建和操作。\n首先，取消了 data value 的存储，key-value 直接通过 paxoslog 存储，称为 paxoslog-as-value。在 Paxos-based 的 key-value 存储中，一对 k-v 与一个 paxoslog 关联。这样可以少一次 I/O，节省硬盘带宽。\n其次，裁剪了 paxoslog 存储，只存储最新的两个数据历史，如图 5 所示，早于最新的数据被视为过时的，可以被删除，所以对于 k-v data 的 PaxosLog 长度恒定为 2。由于 PaxosLog 不会增大，所以可以消除对于数据更新对于内存和硬盘的影响，节省存储和计算计算。此外，简化了 k-v 数据的恢复。最新的 PaxosLog 包含了最新 k-v 数据的快照，可以在出问题时直接恢复数据。\n\n相比之下，正常数据的恢复需要对于 PaxosLog 在 last checkpoint 开始重放所有历史 log entry（如图 4 中表示），尤其是面向集合的数据结构，例如 list, queue,set\n2.2.3 一致性读写 (Consistent Scheme)\nPaxosStore 被设计为多地系统，在多个数据中心之上运行，同时采用 Paxos 协议以 leaseless 方式保证操作的共识，即每个节点可以同等处理数据。具体而言，通过所有副本节点的写作处理每个数据访问（读/写），并依赖 PaxosLog 实现数据的一致性保证。\n一致性读。\n一致性写。\n2.3 存储层 (Storage Layer)\n微信生产系统中的应用提出了多种数据访问的要求以及性能问题。在重组上一代存储系统之后，我们意识到在存储层支持多种存储模型是必要的。这启发了 PaxosStore 存储层的设计，基于不同的存储模型构建多个存储引擎。具体来说，BitCask 和 LSM-tree 是在 PaxosStore 中使用的两种主要模型，都是为了 key-value 存储设计:Bitcask 模型在单点查询更优，LSM-tree 在范围查询上更优。我们在存储层中实现了两种存储引擎，主要设计可用性，效率和可扩展性，不包括共识问题。将共识协议从存储层解耦出来称为中间层，使 PaxosStore 存储层的开发，调优和维护容易很多。存储引擎不仅可以单独调优，还可以协作一起工作，所以支持更加灵活的选项来支持应用特定的需求。\n在 PaxosStore 中最常用的物理数据结构就是 key-value 和关系表。Key-value 原生被 Bitcask 和 LSM-tree 支持。根本上，PaxosStore 的关系表也被存储为 key-value 对，每个表是 value，被唯一 key 索引。但是，简单将表作为普通 key-value 会导致性能问题，因为大多数表都是频繁读取的，而且通常每张表包含成千上百个行，但是微信应用一次大多只访问其中一两行。因此，磁盘/SSD 和内存之间频繁的读写严重影响系统性能。为了解决这个问题，PaxosStore 采用了 differentail update 技术降低表更新的开销。为此，将表分解为两个元表:读优化的 main-table 管理表的主要数据，写优化的 delta-table 管理表的变化（比如更新，插入，删除）。因此表的访问是通过 main-table 的 view 结合 delta-table 管理的增量数据。更深一步，为了保持 delta-table 最小化（保留写友好的属性），会定时将增量数据合并回 main-table\n3. 容错性与可用性 (Fault Tolerance and Availability)\n3.1 容错 (Fault-tolerant Scheme)\n3.2 数据恢复 (Data Recovery)\n3.3 优化 (Optimizations)\n4. 实现 (Implementation）\n总结:\n\n线程多导致同步状态负载，所以实现了 libco 协程，以同步的方式实现异步性能，除了 Paxos 算法本身显式异步编程\n节点间通信，每台服务器以批量方式发送数据包，节省网络带宽。每个服务器还维护多个 socket 连接着同一机器，每个套接字轮流运行发送批处理的数据包，这样可以将数据的批处理分散到多个 socket 上\n\n5. 评估 (Evaluation)\n5.1 实验步骤\n5.2 延迟\n5.3 容错性\n5.4 错误恢复\n5.5 Effectiveness of PaxosLog-Entry Batched Applying\n5.6 PaxosStore 在微信中的应用\n5.6.1 服务即时消息 (Serving Instant Messaging)\n5.6.2 服务社交网络 (Serving Social Networking)\n6. Related Work\n略\n与 raft 不同的是，本文的 paxos 采用无租约设计，没有换主的不可用问题，可以不停机快速故障恢复\n7. Conslusion\n在本文中，我们详细解读了 PaxosStore，它是一个高可用性的存储系统，每秒可以承受数千万次的一致性读/写操作。PaxosStore 中的存储协议基于 Paxos 算法达成分布式共识，并在实际应用中对其进行了进一步优化，包括用于 key-value 存储的 PaxosLog-as-value 和 裁剪 PaxosLog 结构。基于细粒度数据检查点的容错方案使 PaxosStore 能够在故障时支持快速数据恢复，而不会导致系统停机。PaxosStore 已经在微信中实施和部署，为微信集成服务（如即时消息和社交网络）提供存储支持。\n在 PaxosStore 的开发过程中，我们总结了几个设计原则和经验教训:\n\n建议不要通过妥协的单一存储引擎支持存储多样性，而是设计这样的存储层，让它能够支持为不同存储模型构建的多个存储引擎。这种方法有助于开发者在操作维护的动态方面进行有针对性的性能调整。\n除错误和故障外，系统过载也是影响系统可用性的关键因素。特别是在设计系统容错方案时，我们必须对过载引起的潜在雪崩效应给予足够的重视。 一个具体的例子是在 PaxosStore 中使用迷你集群组 (mini-cluster group)。\nPaxosStore 的设计大幅借鉴了基于消息传递的事件驱动机制，这可能会涉及逻辑实现方面的大量异步状态机转换。 在构建 PaxosStore 的工程实践中，我们开发了一个基于协程和 socket hook 的框架，以便于以  pseudo-synchronous 方式对异步过程进行编程。这有助于消除容易出错的函数回调，并简化了异步逻辑的实现过程。\n\n8.

  // Will clear name field.\nCHECK(!message.has_name());\n\n\n如果解析器看到 oneof 中有多个字段，解析出来的 message 只会是最后一个\nExtensions 不支持 oneof\n反射 API 也可以用于 oneof\n可以设置一个 oneof 字段默认值，然后最后一个被序列化\n如果使用 C++，注意代码不要 crash。下面的代码就会 crash，因为 sub_message 已经被删除了，当调用 set_name 时SampleMessage message;\nSubmessage *sub_message = message.mutable_sub_message();\nmessage.set_name(\"name\"); // will delete sub_message\nsub_message-&gt;set_... // crash here\n\n\n还是 C++，如果你 Swap 两个有 oneof 特性的 message，会有对方最后一个 oneof，例子中， msg1 有 sub_message， msg2 有 nameSampleMessage msg1;\nmsg1.set_name(\"name\");\nSampleMessage msg2;\nmsg2.mutable_sub_message();\nmsg1.swap(&amp;msg2);\nCHECK(msg1.has_sub_message());\nCHECK(msg2.has_name());\n\n\n\n后向兼容问题\n注意增加，删除 oneof 字段时，如果 check 返回 None/NOT_SET，意味着 oneof 没有被 set 或者设置其他版本的 oneof。无法区分\n所以 ！！！ 就认为 oneof 没有兼容性\nMaps\nmap&lt;key_type, value_type&gt; map_field = N;\n\nkey_type 任意整数类型或者字符串类型。注意 enum 不能作为 key_type。value_type 可以是出了 map 之外的任何类型\nmap API 现在支持所有 PB2 的语言\n特性\n\nExtensions 不支持 map\nmaps 不使用 repeated, optional, required\nWire format 顺序和 map 迭代是不确定的\n生成文本格式时，map 通过 key 排序，数字 key 以数字顺序\n从 wire 格式解析，或者 merging，如果有重复 map key，使用后面的值。解析文本格式，如果有重复 key 就会报错\n\n兼容\nmap 只是一个语法糖，实际上与下面的定义相等，所以即使 PB 实现不支持 map，也可以处理数据\nmessage MapFieldEntry {\n  optional key_type key = 1;\n  optional value_type value = 2;\n}\n\nrepeated MapFieldEntry map_field = N;\n\n定义服务\nservice SearchService {\n  rpc Search(SearchRequest) returns (SearchResponse);\n}\n\n默认，PB 编译器会生成抽象接口 SearchService 以及关联 stub 实现。stub 传递所有的调用为 RpcChannel，是一个抽象接口，你需要自己定义接口逻辑。比如，你可以将 RpcChannel 实现为序列化一个 message 然后通过 HTTP 发送到一个服务端。换句话说，生成的 stub 提供了一个类型安全的接口，并没有限制你做任何实现。所以，C++代码的例子如下：\nusing google::protobuf;\n\nprotobuf::RpcChannel* channel;\nprotobuf::RpcController* controller;\nSearchService* service;\nSearchRequest request;\nSearchResponse response;\n\nvoid DoSearch() {\n  // You provide classes MyRpcChannel and MyRpcController, which implement\n  // the abstract interfaces protobuf::RpcChannel and protobuf::RpcController.\n  channel = new MyRpcChannel(\"somehost.example.com:1234\");\n  controller = new MyRpcController;\n\n  // The protocol compiler generates the SearchService class based on the\n  // definition given above.\n  service = new SearchService::Stub(channel);\n\n  // Set up the request.\n  request.set_query(\"protocol buffers\");\n\n  // Execute the RPC.\n  service-&gt;Search(controller, request, response, protobuf::NewCallback(&amp;Done));\n}\n\nvoid Done() {\n  delete service;\n  delete channel;\n  delete controller;\n}\n\n所有的 service 类实现 Service 接口，这样提供了编译器不知道方法名称或者输入输出类型的进行调用的方法。服务端，可以这样实现：\nusing google::protobuf;\n\nclass ExampleSearchService : public SearchService {\n public:\n  void Search(protobuf::RpcController* controller,\n              const SearchRequest* request,\n              SearchResponse* response,\n              protobuf::Closure* done) {\n    if (request-&gt;query() == \"google\") {\n      response-&gt;add_result()-&gt;set_url(\"http://www.google.com\");\n    } else if (request-&gt;query() == \"protocol buffers\") {\n      response-&gt;add_result()-&gt;set_url(\"http://protobuf.googlecode.com\");\n    }\n    done-&gt;Run();\n  }\n};\n\nint main() {\n  // You provide class MyRpcServer.  It does not have to implement any\n  // particular interface; this is just an example.\n  MyRpcServer server;\n\n  protobuf::Service* service = new ExampleSearchService;\n  server.ExportOnPort(1234, service);\n  server.Run();\n\n  delete service;\n  return 0;\n}\n\n如果不想实现你自己的 RPC 系统，可以直接使用 gRPC。\nOptions\n.proto文件可以通过 options 来 annotate，会影响处理的上下文。所有的 options 定义在 google.protobuf/descriptor.proto\n\nfile-level options \nMessage-level options\nfiled-level options\n\n比如：\n\n\njava_package (file option) \noption java_package = \"com.example.foo\";\n\n生成的 java 代码 package \n\n\noptimize_for (file option) SPEED(default), CODE_SIZE, LITE_RUNTIME\n会影响 C++ 和 Java 代码的生成\n\n\nmessage_set_wire_format (message option) 对于C++代码开启 arena allocation \nmessage Foo {\n\toption message_set_wire_format = true;\n\textensions 4 to max;\n}\n\n只是例子，Google 之外的开发者不需要这个\n\n\npacked (field option)：如果在 repeated numeric type 上开启，encode 更加紧凑，这个 option 没有坏处，pb3 默认开启\nrepeated int32 samples = 4 [packed = true];\n\n\n\ndeprecated (filed option): 开启表明这个 filed 废弃，Java 中会加上 @Deprecated 注解\n\n\ncustom options\n还可以自定义 options\nexample: \nimport \"google/protobuf/descriptor.proto\"\n\nextend google.protobuf.MessageOptions {\n\toptional string my_option = 51234;\n}\n\nmessage MyMessage {\n\toptional (my_option) = \"Hello world!\";\n}\n\n// 这样我们定义了 message-level option\n\n然后 C++ 中可以这样使用\nstring value = MyMessage::descriptor()-&gt;options().GetExtension(my_option);\n\nimport \"google/protobuf/descriptor.proto\"\n\nextend google.protobuf.FileOptions {\n\toptional string my_file_option = 50000;\n}\nextend google.protobuf.MessageOptions {\n  optional int32 my_message_option = 50001;\n}\nextend google.protobuf.FieldOptions {\n  optional float my_field_option = 50002;\n}\nextend google.protobuf.OneofOptions {\n  optional int64 my_oneof_option = 50003;\n}\nextend google.protobuf.EnumOptions {\n  optional bool my_enum_option = 50004;\n}\nextend google.protobuf.EnumValueOptions {\n  optional uint32 my_enum_value_option = 50005;\n}\nextend google.protobuf.ServiceOptions {\n  optional MyEnum my_service_option = 50006;\n}\nextend google.protobuf.MethodOptions {\n  optional MyMessage my_method_option = 50007;\n}\n\noption (my_file_option) = \"Hello world!\";\n\nmessage MyMessage {\n  option (my_message_option) = 1234;\n\n  optional int32 foo = 1 [(my_field_option) = 4.5];\n  optional string bar = 2;\n  oneof qux {\n    option (my_oneof_option) = 42;\n\n    string quux = 3;\n  }\n}\n\nenum MyEnum {\n  option (my_enum_option) = true;\n\n  FOO = 1 [(my_enum_value_option) = 321];\n  BAR = 2;\n}\n\nmessage RequestType {}\nmessage ResponseType {}\n\nservice MyService {\n  option (my_service_option) = FOO;\n\n  rpc MyMethod(RequestType) returns(ResponseType) {\n    // Note:  my_method_option has type MyMessage.

If a field has the default value in the protocol buffer, it will be omitted in the JSON-encoded data by default to save space. An implementation may provide options to emit fields with default values in the JSON-encoded output.\nproto3JSONJSON exampleNotes\nmessageobject{\"fooBar\": v, \"g\": null, …}Generates JSON objects. Message field names are mapped to lowerCamelCase and become JSON object keys. If the json_name field option is specified, the specified value will be used as the key instead.

Proto3 JSON parsers are required to accept both the converted lowerCamelCase name and the proto field name.\nEmit enum values as integers instead of strings: The name of an enum value is used by default in JSON output. An option may be provided to use the numeric value of the enum value instead.\n\nprotobuf style\n原文\n请注意，PB 已经随着时间而发展，因此你可能会看到不同风格编写的 .proto 文件，修改这些文件时，请尊重现有风格，一致性是关键。但是创建新的 .proto 文件时，请采用当前的最新风格\n标准文件格式\n\n每行不超过 80 字符\n使用 2 空格缩进\n最好对字符串使用双引号\n\n文件结构\n文件命名 lower_snake_case.proto\n所有文件应该以下列顺序排布：\n\nLicense header (if applicable)\nFile overview\nSyntax\nPackage\nImports (sorted)\nFile options\nEverything else \n\nPackages\nPackages 名称应该小写，还应该匹配文件层级。比如如果文件在 my/package/，package 名称应该为 my.package\nMessage 和 field names\n使用 CamelCase 命名 message -- 比如，SongServerRequest，使用 underscore_separated_names 命名 field name，比如 song_name\nmessage SongServerRequest {\n  optional string song_name = 1;\n}\n\n这种命名约定，语言生成为\n// cpp\nconst string&amp; song_name() {...}\nvoid set_song_name(const string&amp; x) {...}\n\n// java\npublic String getSongName() {...}\npublic Builder setSongName(String v) {...}\n\n如果你的 field name 包含一个数字，不需要加下划线，比如应该是 song_name1 而不是 song_name_1\nRepeated fields\n使用复数命名这种 field\nrepeated string keys = 1;\n...\nrepeated MyMessage accounts = 17;\n\nEnums\n使用 CamelCase 命名 enum type name，使用 CPPITALS_WITH_UNDERSOCRES 命名 value name\nenum FooBar {\n  FOO_BAR_UNSPECIFIED = 0;\n  FOO_BAR_FIRST_VALUE = 1;\n  FOO_BAR_SECOND_VALUE = 2;\n}\n\n每个 enum 应该以分号结尾而不是逗号。需要为 enum 值添加前缀，因为历史代码的兼容，没有引入 C++11 的 enum class scope，零 enum 值应该有后缀\nServices\n如果你的 .proto 文件定义 RPC 服务，应该使用 CamelCase 风格，同时应用于服务名和任何RPC方法名\nservice FooService {\n  rpc GetSomething(FooRequest) returns (FooResponse);\n}\n\nThings to avoid\n\n只有 proto2 存在 required field\n只有 proto2 存在 Groups\n\n编码\n原文\n这篇文档阐述了 protobuf 的 message 二进制编码的原理。你在应用中使用 pb 时不需要理解这个，但是知道这些可以更好地帮助你了解使用 pb 编码之后的消息大小\nA simple Message\n来看下这个简单的 message 定义：\nmessage Test1 {\n\toptional int32 a = 1;\n}\n\n应用中，你可以创建 Test1 message 然后 set a  为 150，然后序列化这个 message 作为输出流。如果打印这个流，你可以看到三个字节的内容：\n08 96 01\n\n哇哦，如此小，这意味着什么？且慢慢往下读\nBase 128 Varints\n为了理解简单的 protocol buffer 编码，首先你需要理解 varints，Varints 是一种使用一个或者更多字节序列化整数的方法，越小的数字使用越少的字节数。\n除了最后一个字节外，varint 每个字节都有最高有效位（msb），这表明还有更多的字节在后面。这个字节的低 7 位为一组来存储数字的补码表示，最低有效组在前。\n比如，这有一个数字 1，简单一个字节：\n0000 0001 # 1\n\n300 就要复杂一些：\n1010 1100 0000 0010 # 300\n\n你如何认出这是 300 呢，首先丢掉每个字节的最高有效位（只是表示是不是最后一个字节）\n1010 1100 0000 0010\n-&gt;\n 010 1100  000 0010\n\n然后以 7 位一组反向整个二进制序列，就像前面所述，varints 保存数字式，最小有效组在前，然后你可以按照补码的正常计算方式来计算数字（正数的补码就是直接转化的二进制）\n000 0010  010 1100\n→  000 0010 ++ 010 1100\n→  100101100\n→  256 + 32 + 8 + 4 = 300\n\nMessage Structure\n如你所知，一个 pb message 就是一系列的 key-value 对，序列化为二进制后的 message 使用域号 (field number) 作为 key--每个字段的名称和声明的类型只能在解码端通过引用消息类型的定义来确定。\n当 message 编码时，keys 和 values 被连接成字节流。当 message 解码时，解析器需要跳过不认识的域。这样的话，新的域才能在不影响老程序的情况下添加到 message 的后面。最终，编码后的 message 中每对 key-value 取决于两个值--.proto文件中的域号（field number)，声明的类型（为了了解信息的字节长度）。在大多数的语言实现中，key 也被称为 tag。\n有效的类型声明如下表：\nTypeMeaningUsed For\n0Varintint32, int64, uint32, uint64, sint32, sint64, bool, enum\n164-bitfixed64, sfixed64, double\n2Length-delimitedstring, bytes, embedded messages, packed repeated fields\n3Start groupgroups (deprecated)\n4End groupgroups (deprecated)\n532-bitfixed32, sfixed32, float\n\n字节流里的每个 key 的 value 都是(field_number &lt;&lt; 3) | wire_type这样组成，换句话说，最后三位存储声明类型\n现在，让我们再次看那个简单的例子。你已经知道第一个第一个数字总是 varint key，这里就是08，或者丢掉最高标志位：\n000 1000\n\n你可以通过获取最后三位得到声明的类型（0），然后右移三位获得域号（1）。现在你知道了域号是 1，接下来的字节还是 varint。使用前面知道的解码知识，你可以看到后面两个字节存储了 150 这个值\n96 01 = 1001 0110  0000 0001\n       → 000 0001  ++  001 0110 (drop the msb and reverse the groups of 7 bits)\n       → 10010110\n       → 128 + 16 + 4 + 2 = 150\n\nMore Value Types\nSigned Integers\n如同在前面小节看到，所有的 pb 类型为 0 的都被编码为 varints。但是在有符号整形（sint32/sint64），和标准整形（int32/int64）之间如果编码负数存在巨大区别。如果使用标准整形编码负数，varints 的结果总是是个字节长度，实际上，它被看做一个非常大的无符号整数，如果使用有符号整形，varint 使用 ZigZag 编码方式，这更有效率。\nZigZag 编码将有符号整数映射为无符号整数，使得具有较小绝对值的数字（比如-1）也具有较短的 varint 编码值。正是通过正数和负数\"zig-zags\"的方式，使得 -1 被编码为 1， 1 被编码为 2， -2 被编码为 3，以此类推，如同下面表格展示：\nSigned OriginalEncoded As\n00\n-11\n12\n-23\n21474836474294967294\n-21474836484294967295\n\n换句话说，n 会这样编码：\n(n &lt;&lt; 1) ^ (n &gt;&gt; 31)   # for sint32\n(n &lt;&lt; 1) ^ (n &gt;&gt; 63)   # for sint64\n\n注意第二个位右移--(n &gt;&gt; 31)是算术移位的。换句话说，移位的结果不是全 0（n 为正数），就是全 1（n 为负数）。\n当sint32/sint64被解析时，其值将解码回原始的带符号版本。\nNon-Varint Number\n非 varint 数字类型就简单的两种double 和 fixed64，域类型为 1，告诉解析器是一个固定的 64 位的数据块；类似的float 和 fixed32，域类型为 5，告诉解析器固定为 32 位。这两种情况都被存储为小端字节序。\nStrings\n域类型 2（长度受限）表示该值是 varint 编码的长度，后面跟着指定长度的字节。\nmessage Test2 {\n\toptional string b = 2;\n}\n\n设置值为\"testing\"编码为：（TLV）\n12 07 74 65 73 74 69 6e 67\n\n这是\"testing\"的 UTF-8。key 是 0x12 -&gt;\n0001 0010 \n-&gt; 00010 010\n\n得到 field_number = 2，wire_type = 2。varint 的中的值长度为 7，lo 且为 0，我们在其后找到七个字节---我们的字符串。\nEmbedded Messages\n有一个 message 定义中包含了之前的 Test1：\nmessage Test3 {\n\toptional Test1 c = 3;\n}\n\n这是将 Test1 的 a 设置为 150 的编码版本：\n1a 03 08 96 01\n\n正如你所看到的，最后三个字节跟我们第一个例子中一样（08 96 01），在数字 3 后面 - 内嵌的 message 跟 strings 的方式是一样的。\nOptional and Repeated Elements\n如果 proto2 的 message 定义中有repeated类型元素（没有包含参数[packed=true]），编码后的 message 具有零个或者多个具有相同字段编号的 key-value 对。这些重复的值不必要连续，可能跟其他域交叉出现。解析时，元素之间的顺序会保留下来，尽管其他字段的顺序会丢失。在 proto3 中，repeated声明使用packed encoding（下面的 packed repeated fields 节阐述）。\n对于任意 proto3 非repeated域，和 proto2 中的optional域，编码后的 message 可能有也可能没有该字段编号的 key-value 对。\n通常，编码后的 message 不会有一个以上非repeated域。但是解析器必须能够处理这种情况。对于数字和字符串类型，如果同一个域出现了多次，解析器取最后一个值。对于内嵌的 message 域，解析器合并同一个域的多个实例，就像使用Message::MergeFrom方法，表现为所有的奇异域都会被后面的实例替代，奇异内嵌 message 都会被递归式合并，repeated域会被串联起来。这些规则的结果就是，解码两个串联起来的编码 message 提供了解码两条 message 得到相同的结果，例如：\nMyMessage message;\nmessage.ParseFromString(str1 + str2);\n\n// 等于下面的 \nMyMessage message, message2;\nmessage.ParseFromString(str1);\nmessage2.ParseFromString(str2);\nmessage.MergeFrom(message2);\n\n这个特性非常有用，允许你合并两条你不知道类型的 message。\nPacked Repeated Fields\n版本 2.1.0 引入了packed repeated field，在 proto2 中声明为repeated域而且具有[packed=ture]参数的，在 proto3 中，repeated默认使用 packed 打包标量数字类型。这些功能类似repeated fields，但是编码方式不同。packed repeated field包含 0 的元素不会出现在编码后的 message 中。另外，该域的所有元素都打包成域类型为 2 的单个 key-value 对。每个元素的编码方式与之前相同，除了在前面没有 key。\n比如说，假设有一个 message type：\nmessage Test4 {\t\n  repeated int32 d = 4 [packed = true];\n}\n\n让我们现在构造一个 Test4，提供 field d 的值为 3270 和 86942。然后编码后的形式如下：\n22        // key (field number 4, wire type 2)\n06        // payload size (6 bytes)\n03        // first element (varint 3)\n8E 02     // second element (varint 270)\n9E A7 05  // third element (varint 86942)\n\n只有repeated的数字类型（使用 varint，32/64 位的 wire-type）会被打包编码。\n值得注意的是尽管没有理由为一个repeated field编码超多一个 key-value 对，编码器必须能够接受多个 key-value 对。这种情况下，payload 应该串联起来。每个对必须包含一整个元素。\npb 解析器必须能够解析通过packed编码的repeated域，就好像没有使用packed一样，反之亦然。这才能使得有没有加[packed = true]的前后兼容的方式添加新字段。\nField Order\n域号（Field Number）可以在.proto文件中以任何顺序使用。顺序的选择不会影响 message 的序列化。\n当 message 序列化时，对于如何写入已知或者未知域没有顺序保证。序列化顺序是一个实现细节，将来任何实现的细节可能都会改变。因此 protobuf 的解析器必须能够解析任意顺序域的编码。\nImplications 含义\n\n\n不要假定序列化之后的 message 字节输出是稳定的，对于那些表示其他 pb 序列化消息的传递性字节域尤其是。\n\n\n默认情况下，在同一个 pb message 实例上多次调用序列化方法可能会得到不同的输出；即，默认序列化输出是不确定性的\n\n确定性序列化只能保证相同的二进制字节序列。字节输出可能在不通的版本之间有变化\n\n\n\n下列检查对于 pb message 实例 foo 可能是失败的：\n\nfoo.SerializeAsString() == foo.SerializeAsString()\nHash(foo.SerializeAsString()) == Hash(foo.SerializeAsString())\nCRC(foo.SerializeAsString()) == CRC(foo.SerializeAsString())\nFingerPrint(foo.SerializeAsString()) == FingerPrint(foo.SerializeAsString())\n\n\n\n有一些逻辑等效的 pb message 实例foo和bar可能序列化输出不同的场景：\n\nbar被老服务器序列化表示有些域是未知的\nbar被序列化时是不同语言实现的导致序列化域号顺序不同\nbar存在不确定性序列化的域\nbar有一个域，用于存储 pb message 的序列化字节输出，该 message 的序列化输出不同\nbar使用新的服务器序列化，实现不通导致输出不同\nfoo和bar被单独的 message 以不通顺序串联起来\n\n\n\n\n序列化原理\nProtocol Buffers 是一种轻便高效的结构化数据存储格式，可以用于结构化数据串行化，或者说序列化。它很适合做数据存储或数据交换格式。可用于通讯协议、数据存储等领域的语言无关、平台无关、可扩展的序列化结构数据格式\nprotobuf2 中修饰符：\n\nrequired : 不可以增加或删除的字段，必须初始化；\noptional :  可选字段，可删除，可以不初始化；\nrepeated : 可重复字段， 对应到 java 文件里，生成的是 List。\n\nprotobuf 的使用\nprotoc -I=SRC_DIR --cpp_out=DST_DIR person.proto\n\n编码原理（重点是类型和域号）\nprotobuf 中的 message 中有很多字段，每个字段的格式：\n修饰符 字段类型 字段名 = 域号；\n\n在序列化时，protobuf 按照TLV的格式序列化每一个字段，T 即 Tag，L 是 value 的长度, V 是该字段对应的 value，。如果字段是一个整形，L 部分会省略。\n序列化后的 Value 按照原样保存在字符串或者文件中，Tag 按照一定转换条件保存起来，序列化之后的结果就是：TagValueTagValue...\nTag 的格式化序列是按照 message 中字段后面的域号和字段类型类转换的，转换公式为：\n(field_number &lt;&lt;

Paxos的问题是什么\n在过去的十年中，Leslie Lamport的Paxos协议几乎已经成为共识的代名词：这是课程中最常教授的协议，共识的大多数实现都是以他为起点。Paxos首先定义了一种能够在单个决定中达成一致的协议，比如单条复制日志。我们称它为\"single-decree Paxos\"（单判决Paxos）。Paxos接着合并多个这种协议完成一些列比如日志的决定（multi-Paxos）。Paxos同时保证安全性和活性，支持集群成员的改变。它的正确性已经得到了证明，并且通常情况下是高效的。\n不幸的是，Paxos有两个重要缺陷。第一个是Paxos非常难以理解。[15]论文中的完整解释并不透明，很少人能成功理解它。结果就是，有数篇论文试图简单地解释Paxos。这些解释集中于single-decree子集，虽然这仍旧存在挑战性。在NSDI2012与会者的非正式调查中，我们发现即使是经验丰富的研究人员，也很少保持对Paxos的理解共识。我们自己也与Paxos争斗过，我们直到读了大量简单解释性的论文和设计自己的替代系统之后，这花了将近一年时间，才理解了这套协议。\n我们假定Paxos的不透明性院子其single-decree子集作为基本元素的设计。Single-decree的Paxos是复杂精细的，导致整个协议分成了两个阶段，使其难以形成简单的直觉性解释而且不能单独来解释。因此，很难形成为什么single-decree协议能够工作的直观理解。multi-Paxos的组成引入了更多的复杂性和微妙性。我们相信能通过其他更为直接和简单的方式分解在多个决策阶段（比如一条日志代替一条entry）达到共识的问题。\n第二个问题是Paxos不能给与构建实际系统良好的指导。原因之一是没有针对multi-Paxos的广泛的共识。Lamport的描述更多的是single-decree的Paxos，他只做了multi-Paxos实现方式的大致构想，没有太多细节。有几种具体化和优化Paxos的尝试，比如文献26,39,13，但是这些文献之间互相不同并且不同于Lamport的概述。比如Chubby这种系统实现了类Paxos算法，但是大部分细节没有公开发表。\n另外，Paxos的结构不利于实现实际系统。这是single-decree分解的另一个结果。比如，单独选择一组日志条目然后融合为序列化的日志是有点好处的，这只增加了复杂性。围绕日志设计一个系统更加容易和高效，在该系统中以约束顺序添加日志条目即可。另一个问题是Paxos的核心使用对称的点对点方法（尽管它暗示了通过使用弱领导形式来优化性能）。在仅做出一个决定的问题中这是有道理的，但是几乎没有实际系统可以使用这种方法。如果需要做出一系列决策，首先选举出一个领导者更加简单快捷，随后领导者来协调决策。\n结果就是，实际系统与Paxos没有什么相似之处。每种开始于Paxos的实现最终以不同的结构来呈现。这是费时而且易错的，Paxos的难以理解性加剧了这个问题。Paxos的形式化可能是证明该理论正确性的良好表达，但是实际的实现跟Paxos的证明完全不同，所以毫无实际价值。下面关于Chubby实现的论述非常经典：\n\nPaxos算法的描述与真实系统的需要有着巨大的差异...因此最终的系统将基于一个没有被证明的协议\n\n由于这些问题，我们得出的结论是Paxos不能为系统构建或教育提供良好的基础。 考虑到共识在大型软件系统中的重要性，我们决定看看是否可以设计一种性能比Paxos好的替代共识算法。 Raft就是这个实验的结果。\n4. 易理解性设计\n我们设计Raft时，有几个目标：比如提供一个完整，易于构建系统的实际基础，以便减少开发人员的设计工作量；它必须在所有条件下是安全的，典型操作场景是可用的，大多数操作是高效的。但是最重要的目标是，也是最大的挑战 -- 易于理解。对于大多数人来说可以容易地理解该算法。另外必须能够建立该算法的直觉，以便系统构建者可以进行实际实现中不可避免的扩展。\n在Raft设计中有很多要点，我们必须在多种方法中进行选择。 在这种情况下，我们根据可理解性评估了替代方案：解释每种替代方案有多难（例如，其状态空间有多复杂，是否有微妙的暗示？），以及对读者来说有多容易完全了解该方法及其含义？\n我们意识到这种分析具有相当高的主观性；不过，我们还是用了两种通用技术。第一个是众所周知的问题分解方法：无论如何，我们分解问题更小使得可以解决，解释和理解。例如，我们将Raft分为了领导者选举，日志复制，安全性和成员改变几个问题。\n我们的第二个方法是通过减少需要考虑的状态简化状态空间，使系统更加协调一致，并在可能的情况下消除不确定性。尤其是，日志不允许有holes，Raft限制了导致互相之间不一致的方式。尽管大多数情况下，我们试图降低不确定性，有些场景引入不确定性可以提升可理解性。尤其是，随机方法引入了不确定性，但是通过相似的处理方法处理所有的可能性减少了状态空间（\"随便选一个，无所谓\"）。我们使用随机化来简化Raft领导者选举算法。\n5. Raft共识算法\nRaft是一个管理第二节描述的复制日志的算法。图2简介的展示了该算法，图3列出了算法的关键属性。图中剩余的属性会在本节分开阐述\n\n\nRaft 通过首先选举一个 leader，然后让这个 leader 完全管理 replicated log 的方式实现共识（consensus）。leader 从客户端接收 log entries，在其他服务器上 replicate log entries ，并告诉其他服务器何时可以安全地将 log entries 应用于它们的状态机。选择一个 leader 简化了管理 replicated log 的工作。比如，leader 可以决定自行决定如何处理新的 log entry，而不需要询问其他服务器，数据流的方向只有从 leader 到 follower。leader 可以挂掉或者与其他服务器断开网络连接，这时新的 leader 会被选出来。\n基于 leader 的方法，Raft 将共识问题分解为三个独立的子问题\n\nLeader election：当现有的 leader 挂掉，必须选出一个新 leader\nLog replication：leader 必须接受来自客户端的 log entries，然后将它们复制到整个集群，强制其他服务器使用 leader 的覆盖\nSafety：安全属性的关键是图3中的 state machine safety 属性：如果任何服务器已经应用了某个 log entry 到状态机，不会有其他服务器在相同的 log index 执行不同的命令。5.4 小节描述 Raft 如何确保这个特性；解决方案就是加了成为 leader 约束\n\n5.1 Raft basics\nRaft 集群包含了一组服务器，5是一个典型的数据，可以容忍两台机器挂掉。在任何给定的事件内，服务器处于三种状态之一：leader, follower, candidate。所谓 normal operation 存在一个 leader ，其他服务器都是 follower。follower 是被动的：不会提出请求只是响应来自 leader 或者 candidate 的请求。leader 来处理所有来自客户端的请求（如果客户端向 follower 发出请求，follower 会将请求重定向到 leader）【译者注：所以TiKV中对这种读请求做了特殊处理，更好的降低leader处理请求的负载，属于case by case 的优化？】。第三种状态， candidate 处于参与选举为 leader 的状态。图4展示了三种状态以及转移条件\n\nRaft 将时间切分成了任意长度的 term，如图5所示。Terms 使用连续整数表示。每个 Term 开始于一次选举，一个或者多个 candidates 试图成为 leader。如果一个 candidate 赢得了选举，这次 term 的剩余时间将作为 leader。有时候，选举不一定只有一个leader【译者注：典型的每个 candidate 同时为自己发起投票，这就出现了冲突】，这种场景，这次 term 就没有 leader， 就会马上进入下一次 term。Raft 保证一个给定的 term 中只有一个 leader。\n\n不同的服务器可以在不同的时间观察到状态的转移，并且某些情况下，服务器可能无法观察到选举甚至整个 term。Term 在 Raft 是逻辑时钟，这可以使得 Raft 算法判断比如老的leader是不是过时的信息。每个服务器存储了当前的 termid，随着时间这个值只能增加。服务器通信的时候，current termid的信息会被交换；如果一个服务的 term 数字小于另一个，就会更新成更大的那个。如果 candidate 或者 leader 发现它们的 term 的已经落后，就会马上转移到 follower 的状态。如果一个服务器接受了过时 term 的请求，就会拒绝这次请求\nRaft 的服务器使用 RPC 通信【译者注：所以 TiKV 中的 gRPC 是更基础的组件？raft-rs 中的 mpsc 是一个模拟】，基本的一致性算法只需要两个 RPC RequestVote 和 AppendEntries。RequestVote 在 candidate 选举时使用，AppendEntries 在 leader 复制自己的 log entry 到整个集群时使用，同时内容为空的时候也作为心跳使用。后面还会再加一个 RPC 用来在服务器之间转移 snapshots。服务器没有收到响应会重试，并且可以并发 RPC 提高性能。\n5.2 Leader 选举\nRaft 使用心跳机制触发 leader 选举，当服务器启动时，都是 follower。服务器会在收到 leader 或者 candidate 的有效 RPC 时保持 follower 的状态。leader 会周期性发出心跳到所有 follower 来保证自己的 “权威”。如果follower 超过一个周期没有收到通信，称为 election timeout，意味着没有可用 leader，并且开始选出新 leader\n为了开始选举，follower 增加 term 的数字，然后转化为 candidate 的状态，然后为自己发出投票。candidate 会一直保持这个状态直到：（a）它自己赢得选举 （b）另一个服务器赢得选举 （c）一个周期时间过去没有任何服务器称为 leader。下面分开讨论这三种情况\ncandidate 在一个 term 内赢得了半数以上的投票。每个服务器最多投一张选票，先来发起的先得（注意后面会为了 saftey 加上更强的约束）。多数的规则确保了最多只有一个 candidate 能赢得选举。一旦 candidate 赢得一次选举，就成为 leader。然后开始向所有其他的服务器发送心跳请求【译者注：这会重置其他服务器的定时器，避免新的选举开始】\n当等待投票时，candidate 可能会收到 AppendEntries 的 RPC。如果 leader 的 term 比 candidate 当前的不小于，那么 candidate 会意识到 leader 是合法的，自己就会退回到 follower 的状态。如果 RPC 中的 term 比自己的小，candidate 会拒绝这次 RPC，继续保持 candidate 状态\n第三种可能的情况就是没有 candidate 赢得选举，如同前面提到的如果很多 follower 同时成为 candidate，就会出现冲突。这种情况发生时，每个 candidate 就会增加自己的 term，开始新一轮选举，但是为了避免无限循环的状况发生，这里引入了随机性来规避\nRaft 使用随机 election timeout来确保投票冲突很少发生，并且如果发生可以快速恢复。固定间隔中随机一个时间（150ms ~ 300ms）【译者注：后面有提到这个时间选择的策略，以及三个时间之间的关系（rpc的通信时间 &lt;&lt; election timeout &lt;&lt; 服务器宕机间隔），并通过证反形式证明 Raft 的正确性】。通常这样做之后只有一台服务器发起投票。\n【译者注：原文还有一段最开始并没有使用随机退避的策略，而是引入优先级系统来解决冲突，但是这使得系统复杂性变高，与容易理解的初衷相悖，这里是一个简要说明，翻译略去，有兴趣可以翻阅原文】\n5.3 Log 复制\n一旦 leader 被选出来，开始服务客户端。每个客户端请求包含了状态机需要执行的命令。leader 追加命令到自己的 log 中成为 new log entry。然后通过 AppendEnteries RPC 并行扩散到集群中的其他服务器。当 entry 已经被安全复制之后，leader 将 entry 应用到状态机，然后将结果返回客户端。如果 follower 宕机或者运行较慢，或者网络丢包，leader 会不断重试，直到所有 follower 保存了所有 log entries\n\nlog 如图6这样组织，每个 log entry 包含一条状态机的命令，和一个 term number。term number 被用来检查 log 之间的矛盾确保图3中的一些性质。每个 log entry 还有一个整数 index 表示在 log 中的位置\nleader 决定是时候将 log entry 应用到状态机时，这样的 entry 被称为 commited。Raft 保证提交的 entry 是持久化的，并且被所有的状态机执行过了。一条 log entry 在 leader 获得多数 follower 复制响应后被提交（图6中是 entry 7）。这意味着之前的 log entry 都已经被提交了，包括上一任 leader 提交的。5.4 节中讨论了一些微妙的场景，当在 leader 发生变化之后应用这条规则，也展现了 commitent 的定义是安全的。 leader 追踪着已知最新的被提交的 log entry，这会在以后的 AppendEntries RPC 中包含，所以其他服务器也会知道。一旦 follower 学习到这个信息，就会应用到自己的状态机。\n我们设计 Raft log 机制来位置不同服务器之间 log 的高度一致。这不仅简化系统行为，更重要的是保证安全【译者注：安全的定义是什么？】。Raft 建立了以下属性，一起确保了 Log Matching Property（图3中）：\n\n如果不同的 log 【译者注：不同服务器/服务进程上的log】的两条 entry有相同的 index 和 term，命令也是一样的\n如果不同的 log 的两条 entry 有相同的 index 和 term，则前面所有的 log entry都是相同的\n\n第一条性质基于这样一个事实，leader 在给定的 term 的给定 log index 最多创建一条 log entry，然后 log entry 不会更改位置。第二条性质由 AppendEntries 进行一致性检查得到保证。当发送 AppendEntries RPC， leader 将 entry 的 index 和 term 信息带上。如果 follower 没有在相同的 term 和 index 找到这条 entry，就会拒绝新的 entry。一致性检查的步骤为：空的log 状态机满足 Log Matching Property， 一致性检查维护了 Log Matching Property。结果就是，leader 的 AppendEntries 返回成功，表示follower 的log在这条 log entry 之前跟自己是保持一致的。\n\n整个正常操作期间，leader 的 log 和 follower 的保持一致，所以 AppendEntries 一致性检查一般不会失败。但是如果 leader 宕机就会丢失 log 一致性（老 leader 可能没有将自己的全部 entry 复制出去）。这种不一致性会导致 leader 和 follower 的一系列问题。图7表明了 follower 的 log 可能与新 leader 的不同。follower 可能会丢失一些 leader 的信息，也可能有一些 log leader 不知道，或者同时存在这两种情况。miss 或者 extraneous entry 可能横跨多个 term\n在 Raft 中，leader 通过强制 follower 使用自己的来处理不一致问题。这意味着，follower 与 leader 不一致的 log 要被 leader 的覆盖。5.4 节会说明，加上一个限制之后这是安全的\n为了使 follower 的 log 与自己的保持一致，leader 必须找到两个 log 的最近交汇点，然后将自己之后的发送给 follower 用来覆盖。通过 AppendEntries 的一致性检查来执行这些操作。 leader 建立起每个 follower 的 nextIndex 的认识，这表示 leader 发送给 follower 的下一个 index。当 leader 初始化时，nextIndex 就是自己 log 的最后一个 index（图7中是11）。如果一个 follower 的 log 与 leader 不一致，AppendEntries RPC 的一致性检查会失败，然后 leader 会将 nextIndex 减 1然后重新发起请求，直到 leader 和 follower 的 nextIndex 匹配上，然后 AppendEntries 成功，会移除 follower 该匹配点之后的所有 log ，然后使用 leader 的来覆盖。\n如果可以，这里多次 RPC 回退 index 的方式可以优化，比如 follower 可以直接回退到 term 的最开始位置。总之就是加速匹配过程。但是实际上我们怀疑这个优化是不是必要，因为实际情况中这种场景应该很小。\n通过这种机制，leader 不需要执行任何特殊操作就可以保持与 follower 的一致性。leader 也不会覆盖自己或者删除自己（图3中的 Leader Append-Only Property）\nlog 复制机制表现出第2节中描述的理想共识属性：Raft 可以接受，复制，应用新的 log entry；正常情况下，log 复制通过一次 RPC 时间就可以达成；一个慢服务器不会影响性能\n5.4 Safety\n前面的小结描述了 Raft 如何选举 leader ，如何复制 log entry。但**是都没有提到状态机是否按照相同的顺序执行相同的命令。**比如，当 leader 提交几条 log entry 时，一个 follower 不可用了，然后他自己被选举成了 leader， 然后使用新的 entry 覆盖了本该执行的命令，这时不同机器的状态机就执行了不同的命令\n本节通过加入哪些服务器可以参与选举leader的约束来完成 Raft 算法。这个约束确保 leader 在给定的 term 包含了所有被提交的 log entry（图3中的 Leader Completeness Property）。给出选举约束之后，提交规则更清晰了。最后，我们给出了 Leader Completeness Property 的证明。\n5.4.1 选举约束\n任何基于 leader 的共识算法中，leader 必须存储了所有被提交的 log entry。有些共识算法没有这个要求，但是这些算法存储了额外的信息，确保新 leader 可以补齐或者丢弃一些 log entry。不幸的是，这会需要算法引入额外的机制和复杂度。Raft 使用更简单的方法来保证所有被提交的 entry 都被 leader 知道，而不想引入额外的转换机制。这意味着 log entry 只需要保证一个流动方向，就是从 leader 到 follower，leader 不需要覆盖写已有的 log\nRaft 在投票过程中拒绝没有包含所有被提交 log entry 的票来实现这一点。candidate 必须联系集群中的多数服务器来获得投片，意味着提交的 entry 至少存在与集群中的一台机器上。如果 candidate 的 log 在多数机器上是 up-to-date （Raft 对比两个 log 的最新 log entry 的 index 和 term 来定义 up-to-date，如果最新 log-entry 有不同的 term，term 大的更加 up-to-date， 相同 term，更大的 index 更加 up-to-date）的，表示持有所有被提交的 entry。RequestVote RPC 这样实现：RPC 中包含 candidate log 的信息，投票者对比这些信息与自己的，如果自己的更 up-to-date 就拒绝这个投票\n5.4.2 在先前的 term 提交 entry 【译者注：这里实际没太看懂，需要查看博士的原论文。】\n5.3节提到过，leader 知道当前 term 已经被提交 entry 已经被多数服务器接受。如果 leader 在提交这条 entry 之前宕机，新的 leader 会试图完成这次复制。但是，leader 不能直接得出结论如果一条 entry 是上一个 term 提交的，图3.7【译者注：这里从 Phd 的原论文中截图，比论文中的画法更容易理解】表明了这个场景，老的 log entry 被存储在了多数服务器上，但是可能被以后的 leader 覆盖。\n\n这个问题的避免，Raft 规定计算复制时，绝对不提交先前 term 的 entry。只有 leader 当前 term 的 log entry 可以被提交，一旦当前 term 的 entry提交，所有先前的 log entry 不能再被修改。有些场景可能 leader 可以安全得出哪些老的 log entry 被提交的结论，但是 Raft 使用保守的策略。\nRaft 接受这种提交规则的复杂性，因为当 leader 从上一个 term 复制 log entry， 会保存他们原始的 term 数字。在其他共识算法中，如果一个新 leader 复制先前 term 的 log entry，必须使用新的 term 来做。Raft 使其变得简单，因为在 log 保持相同的 term。此外 Raft 的新 leader 会比其他共识算法发送更少的先前 term 的 log entry（其他算法发送冗余 log entry 必须重新计算它们）\n5.4.3 Safety 论证（略）\n5.5 Follower 和 candidate 宕机\n到此为止，我们专注于 leader 失败的情况。Follower 或者 candidate 宕机的处理比 leader 更容易，而且处理方式相同。如果 follower 或者 candidate 宕机，将要到来的 RequestVote ， AppendEntries RPC 会失败。Raft 直接无限重试；如果宕机的服务器重启了，RPC 重试成功。如果服务器在接受了请求但是没有发出响应之间宕机，就会收到重复请求。Raft RPC 是可重入的，所以这没有什么问题。\n5.6 时间和可用性\nRaft 安全的一个要求是不依赖时间：系统不能因为某些事件发生的快些或者慢些就返回错误结果。但是，可用性（系统能够连续提供服务的能力）不可避免要依赖时间。比如，如果消息交换消耗比服务器宕机间隔还长，candidate 不能赢得选举，没有稳定 leader ，整个机制就挂了\nLeader 选举是 Raft 中时间起着至关重要的一个方面。Raft 需要满足这个时间条件才能平稳运行：\n$$broadcastTime \\ll electionTimeout \\ll MTBF(average time between failures for a single server)$$\n前面的不等式中 $broadcastTime$ 表示并行 RPC 到集群中每个server的平均时间。$electionTimeout$ 前面描述过，$MTBF$ 表示单台server 的宕机间隔【译者注：一般是月计】。\n前一个不等号保证了 leader 可以成功发送心跳消息，并且不会使集群发生分裂；第二个不等号是系统平稳运行保证。\n$broadcastTime$ 和 $MTBF$ 是底层问题，我们无法控制，但是 $electionTimeout$ 是我们可选的。Raft 一般用于持久化存储的场景，所以可以假定 $broardcastTime$ 在 0.5ms 到 20ms 之间，取决于存储使用的技术。这么看，$electionTimeout$ 应该在 10ms 和 500ms 之间。\n6. 集群成员变化\n【译者注：TiKV 2019-10 才支持论文中提到的 joint consensus，最开始只有一次变动一个成员，所谓的 one point chang at a time】\n之前所有的讨论都是一个集群的配置是固定的。在实际系统中，不可避免会更改配置，比如替换机器。最简单的就是停机，然后更改配置，然后重启集群。这回导致集群有一个不可用时间段。并且如果有操作失误，不可用时间段会更长。为了避免这个问题，决定将配置变更合并到 Raft 共识算法中\n为了使配置变更也安全，在配置迁移过程中不能有点的变化，这可能导致同一个 term 被选举出两个 leader。不幸的是，任何直接切换机器配置的方法都不能避免这个问题。不能直接切换，那么就需要搞个两阶段。直接切换会引起分裂问题，如图10所示\n\n为了保证安全性，配置变更是一个两阶段方法。有多种手段实现两阶段方法。比如有些系统使用第一个阶段来关闭老的配置，这时候不能处理客户端请求；然后第二阶段切换到新配置。【译者注：这只是将上面停机该配置自动化处理了。还是存在不能提供服务的问题】。Raft 中集群首先切换到联合配置，称为 join consensus，一旦 joint sonsensus 被提交，系统就可以继续切换到新配置。Joint consunsus 既包含了就配置，也包含了新配置：\n\nlog entry 被复制到新老配置中所有服务器中\n任何一台服务器可以作为 leader\n选举和 entry 提交需要旧配置和新配置中不同的多数才行\n\njoint consensus 允许单独的服务器在不同时间在配置之间转移，而且不违反安全性。同时，joint consensus 还支持不停机服务客户端，在配置更换期间\n\n集群配置的通信和存储在复制 log 中是特殊的 entry；图11表明了配置更新过程。当leader 收到 切换配置的请求（从 $C_{old}到 C_{new}$），存储 joint consensus 的配置 $C_{old,new}$ 为一条 log entry，然后复制到整个集群。一旦集群都加了这条 log entry，使用最新的配置在将来的决策中。这意味着 leader 将使用 $C_{old,new}$ 的规则来决定 log entry 被提交。如果 leader 宕机，新 leader 是从$C_{old}$或者 $C_{old,new}$ 中选择，取决于 candidate 是否已经收到 $C_{old,new}$。这时，$C_{new}$不能单方面做出决策。\n一旦 $C_{old,new}$ 被提交，就可以继续下一个阶段，leader 可以创建一个 $C_{new}$ 的 log entry，然后扩散到集群。当 $C_{new}$ 被提交时，$C_{old}$ 就失效了，不再新配置的机器就可以关机了。图11中表示，没有任何时间 $C_{old}$ 和 $C_{new}$ 同时分别做出决策，这保证了安全。\n重新配置也提出了三个问题：\n\n新服务器可能没有存储 log 。如果新加入集群，需要一定时间初始化，这个时间内不能提交新的 log entry。为了避免可用性间隔，Raft 引入了一个额外的阶段在更改配置之前，加入集群的服务器没有投票权（leader 会复制 log 给它们，但是在多数选择时不被考虑）。一旦新服务器已经跟上了其他服务器，配置变更过程才会被触发\n集群 leader 可能不在新配置中。这种情况，leader 一旦要提交 log entry 在 $C_{new}$ 就回退到 follower 状态。这表示当 leader 管理本身不在其中的集群时，有一定时间，复制 log entry 但是不能在多数计算时，计算自己。当 $C_{new}$ 生效时，会发生领导者转换。在这之前，可能有来自 $C_{old}$ 的机器称为 leader\n被新配置移除的机器可能会破坏集群。这些机器不能收到心跳，所以会 timeout然后开始新选举。然后使用新的 term 发起 RequestVotes RPC，会造成当前的 leader 回退到 follower 的状态，新leader被选举，但是被移除的机器会不断超时发起新一轮选举。为了避免这个问题，服务器会丢弃 RequestVotes 请求，如果服务器收到请求在来自当前 leader 告知的最小 election timeout 之内。这不会影响正常选举，每个服务器会等待至少 minimum election timeout 在开始下一次选举之前。\n\n7. Log 压缩\nRaft 的 log 随着不断地 normal operation【译者注：normal operation 指的是正常请求，confchange 应该不属于 normal operation】，实际系统中，这个大小是无界的。随着 log 的增长，占用更多的空间，需要更多的时间重放。如果没有机制来丢弃 log 中累积的过时信息，就会造成可用性问题。\nSnapshotting 是最简单的压缩方法。当前整个系统的状态被写入到硬盘的 snapshot 文件中，然后这个时间之前的 log 都可以废弃。Chubby 和 Zookeeper 中使用了 snapshotting，本节接下来就会阐述 Raft 中如何使用 snapshot\n增量压缩，比如 log clean 和 LSM-tree，也是可能的。这些操作一次作用于部分数据，所以可以更快的压缩。首先选择数据的 region，然后重写活动的数据，然后释放 region。这需要额外的机制，并且相比 snapshotting 更加复杂。虽然 log clean 需要修改 Raft 算法，但是状态机可以实现 LSM-tree 使用与 snapshotting 相同的接口\n\n图12 展示了 Raft 中 snapshotting 的基本思想，每个服务器独立 snapshot，覆盖已经提交的 log。包括：状态机将当前状态写入 snapshot。Raft 好包括了一部分 snapshot 的 metadata ：snapshot 中的 last included index（最新的状态机提交的 index），last included term是这个 entry 的term。要存这些信息是为了支持 AppendEntries 连贯性检查在 snapshot 之后的第一条新 log entry。为了支持第6节描述的成员变更，snapshot 还要包含最新 log 的配置信息。一旦服务器完成 snapshot，可以删除 last included entry之前的所有 log 和之前的所有 snapshot\n尽管服务器可以独立的 snapshot，leader 也需要偶尔发送 snapshot 给 follower。当 leader 丢弃了 next log entry 时，需要通知 follower。幸运的是，通常不会发生这种场景，一般 follower 追随 leader 很好。但是一个非常慢的 follower 或者新加入集群的服务器没有最新信息，需要 leader 发送 snapshot 。\n\nleader 使用 RPC InstallSnapshot 来向 follower 发送 snapshot，图13描述了这个 RPC。当 follower 收到一个 snapshot，必须决定如何处理已有的存在的 log entry。通常 snapshot 包含的就是全部最新信息。这时，follower 丢弃全部自己的 log 全部由 snapshot 替代。如果 follower 收到的 snapshot 是自己 log 的前缀（错误？），快照覆盖的部分使用 snapshot 的信息，后面的自己要保留\nsnapshot 方法从 Raft 的强 leader 原则中分离出来，因为 follower 可以不需要 leader 的信息自行 snapshot。所以，分离也是合理的，同时有一个 leader 帮助在达成共识时避免冲突，在 snapshot 时已经达成了共识，所以没有决策上的冲突。数据流还是从 leader 到 follower ，只是 follower 可以自行组织自己的数据。\n【译者注：这里如果使用基于 leader 的 snapshot，将浪费巨大的网络带宽，并且 snaphot 会很慢。而且，leader 实现更复杂，比如， leader 需要并行处理 snapshot 到 follower 以及 new log entry 到 follower】\n这里 snapshot 有两个主要问题：\n\n服务器决定什么时候 snapshot。如果过于频繁 snapshot，浪费硬盘带宽和功耗，如果频率太低，会撑爆存储，而且会增加重放 log 的时间。一个简单的策略就是当 log 到达一个固定大小的时候进行 snapshot。如果此大小设置明显大于 snapshot 的预期大小，则 snapshot 的磁盘带宽开销将很小\n第二个性能问题就是 snapshot 的写入会消耗时间，我们不能延迟正常操作。解决方案是使用 copy-on-write 技术，所以新的 log entry 可以被接受而不会影响 snapshot 的写入。操作系统的 copy-on-write 支持可以创造整个状态机的的 in-memory snapshot\n\n8. 客户端协作\n本节描述客户端如何与 Raft 交互，包括客户端如何与集群 leader 交互和 Raft 如何保证线性化语义。这些问题适用于所有共识系统，Raft 的解决方案是类似的\nRaft 的客户端发送所有请求到 leader，当客户端启动时，随机连接一个服务器。如果客户端第一次选择不是 leader，服务器会拒绝这次请求并返回 leader 的地址。如果 leader 宕机，客户端会超时，然后随机重试一台服务器。\nRaft 的目标是实现线性化语义（每个操作连续执行，并且执行一次）。但是 Raft 可能会执行一条命令多次：比如，如果 leader 在提交了 log entry 但是返回客户端响应之间宕机，客户端会重试这条命令，造成一条命令执行多次。解决方法就是客户端在每条命令中增加一个唯一的序列号，然后状态机跟踪每个客户端执行的最新的序列号。如果收到过时的序列号，不会执行这次请求中的命令\n只读操作不写入 log，但是，如果没有额外信息，这会冒着返回过时数据的风险，因为响应请求的 leader 可能已经被新的 leader 取代。不能返回过时数据，所以 Raft 采用两个措施来避免这个问题（a）leader 必须有哪条 entry 是最新被提交的信息。Leader Completeness Property 保证了 leader 有所有的提交 entry，但是term的开始，可能不知道，所以每次 term 开始马上提交一次 entry，Raft 会使 leader 在新的 term 提交一个空的 entry 来保证这一点（b）leader 必须在处理只读请求时检查是否是过时请求（如果更新的 leader 被选举出来，这次请求就是过时的），Raft 在处理请求前与集群交换心跳信息来处理这个问题。或者，leader 可以通过心跳机制来提供租约，但是这对系统的时间要求比较高（系统不能存在严重的时间不一致）\n9，10，11，12\n为实现的代码，实验的性能数据与对比\n相关工作\n总结结论\n致谢\n","id":"https://wendajiang.github.io/raft-extended/","title":"raft-extended"},"https://wendajiang.github.io/redis-distribute-lock/":{"body":"翻译\n原文：redis 官方推荐\nmartin kleppmann 对于 redlock 的评论\n整体讨论[转载]\nhttp://zhangtielei.com/posts/blog-redlock-reasoning.html\nhttp://zhangtielei.com/posts/blog-redlock-reasoning-part2.html\n关于 Redis 分布式锁的安全性问题，在分布式系统专家 Martin Kleppmann 和 Redis 的作者 antirez 之间就发生过一场争论。由于对这个问题一直以来比较关注，所以我前些日子仔细阅读了与这场争论相关的资料。这场争论的大概过程是这样的：为了规范各家对基于 Redis 的分布式锁的实现，Redis 的作者提出了一个更安全的实现，叫做 Redlock。有一天，Martin Kleppmann 写了一篇 blog，分析了 Redlock 在安全性上存在的一些问题。然后 Redis 的作者立即写了一篇 blog 来反驳 Martin 的分析。但 Martin 表示仍然坚持原来的观点。随后，这个问题在 Twitter 和 Hacker News 上引发了激烈的讨论，很多分布式系统的专家都参与其中。\n对于那些对分布式系统感兴趣的人来说，这个事件非常值得关注。不管你是刚接触分布式系统的新手，还是有着多年分布式开发经验的老手，读完这些分析和评论之后，大概都会有所收获。要知道，亲手实现过 Redis Cluster 这样一个复杂系统的 antirez，足以算得上分布式领域的一名专家了。但对于由分布式锁引发的一系列问题的分析中，不同的专家却能得出迥异的结论，从中我们可以窥见分布式系统相关的问题具有何等的复杂性。实际上，在分布式系统的设计中经常发生的事情是：许多想法初看起来毫无破绽，而一旦详加考量，却发现不是那么天衣无缝。\nRedlock 算法\n就像本文开头所讲的，借助 Redis 来实现一个分布式锁 (Distributed Lock) 的做法，已经有很多人尝试过。人们构建这样的分布式锁的目的，是为了对一些共享资源进行互斥访问。\n但是，这些实现虽然思路大体相近，但实现细节上各不相同，它们能提供的安全性和可用性也不尽相同。所以，Redis 的作者 antirez 给出了一个更好的实现，称为 Redlock，算是 Redis 官方对于实现分布式锁的指导规范。Redlock 的算法描述就放在 Redis 的官网上：\n\nhttps://redis.io/topics/distlock\n\n在 Redlock 之前，很多人对于分布式锁的实现都是基于单个 Redis 节点的。而 Redlock 是基于多个 Redis 节点（都是 Master）的一种实现。为了能理解 Redlock，我们首先需要把简单的基于单 Redis 节点的算法描述清楚，因为它是 Redlock 的基础。\n基于单 Redis 节点的分布式锁\n首先，Redis 客户端为了获取锁，向 Redis 节点发送如下命令：\nSET resource_name my_random_value NX PX 30000\n\n上面的命令如果执行成功，则客户端成功获取到了锁，接下来就可以访问共享资源了；而如果上面的命令执行失败，则说明获取锁失败。\n注意，在上面的SET命令中：\n\nmy_random_value是由客户端生成的一个随机字符串，它要保证在足够长的一段时间内在所有客户端的所有获取锁的请求中都是唯一的。\nNX表示只有当resource_name对应的 key 值不存在的时候才能SET成功。这保证了只有第一个请求的客户端才能获得锁，而其它客户端在锁被释放之前都无法获得锁。\nPX 30000表示这个锁有一个 30 秒的自动过期时间。当然，这里 30 秒只是一个例子，客户端可以选择合适的过期时间。\n\n最后，当客户端完成了对共享资源的操作之后，执行下面的 Redis Lua 脚本来释放锁：\nif redis.call(\"get\",KEYS[1]) == ARGV[1] then\n    return redis.call(\"del\",KEYS[1])\nelse\n    return 0\nend\n\n这段 Lua 脚本在执行的时候要把前面的my_random_value作为ARGV[1]的值传进去，把resource_name作为KEYS[1]的值传进去。\n至此，基于单 Redis 节点的分布式锁的算法就描述完了。这里面有好几个问题需要重点分析一下。\n首先第一个问题，这个锁必须要设置一个过期时间。否则的话，当一个客户端获取锁成功之后，假如它崩溃了，或者由于发生了网络分割（network partition）导致它再也无法和 Redis 节点通信了，那么它就会一直持有这个锁，而其它客户端永远无法获得锁了。antirez 在后面的分析中也特别强调了这一点，而且把这个过期时间称为锁的有效时间 (lock validity time)。获得锁的客户端必须在这个时间之内完成对共享资源的访问。\n第二个问题，第一步获取锁的操作，网上不少文章把它实现成了两个 Redis 命令：\nSETNX resource_name my_random_value\nEXPIRE resource_name 30\n\n虽然这两个命令和前面算法描述中的一个SET命令执行效果相同，但却不是原子的。如果客户端在执行完SETNX后崩溃了，那么就没有机会执行EXPIRE了，导致它一直持有这个锁。\n第三个问题，也是 antirez 指出的，设置一个随机字符串my_random_value是很有必要的，它保证了一个客户端释放的锁必须是自己持有的那个锁。假如获取锁时SET的不是一个随机字符串，而是一个固定值，那么可能会发生下面的执行序列：\n\n客户端 1 获取锁成功。\n客户端 1 在某个操作上阻塞了很长时间。\n过期时间到了，锁自动释放了。\n客户端 2 获取到了对应同一个资源的锁。\n客户端 1 从阻塞中恢复过来，释放掉了客户端 2 持有的锁。\n\n之后，客户端 2 在访问共享资源的时候，就没有锁为它提供保护了。\n第四个问题，释放锁的操作必须使用 Lua 脚本来实现。释放锁其实包含三步操作：'GET'、判断和'DEL'，用 Lua 脚本来实现能保证这三步的原子性。否则，如果把这三步操作放到客户端逻辑中去执行的话，就有可能发生与前面第三个问题类似的执行序列：\n\n客户端 1 获取锁成功。\n客户端 1 访问共享资源。\n客户端 1 为了释放锁，先执行'GET'操作获取随机字符串的值。\n客户端 1 判断随机字符串的值，与预期的值相等。\n客户端 1 由于某个原因阻塞住了很长时间。\n过期时间到了，锁自动释放了。\n客户端 2 获取到了对应同一个资源的锁。\n客户端 1 从阻塞中恢复过来，执行DEL操纵，释放掉了客户端 2 持有的锁。\n\n实际上，在上述第三个问题和第四个问题的分析中，如果不是客户端阻塞住了，而是出现了大的网络延迟，也有可能导致类似的执行序列发生。\n前面的四个问题，只要实现分布式锁的时候加以注意，就都能够被正确处理。但除此之外，antirez 还指出了一个问题，是由 failover 引起的，却是基于单 Redis 节点的分布式锁无法解决的。正是这个问题催生了 Redlock 的出现。\n这个问题是这样的。假如 Redis 节点宕机了，那么所有客户端就都无法获得锁了，服务变得不可用。为了提高可用性，我们可以给这个 Redis 节点挂一个 Slave，当 Master 节点不可用的时候，系统自动切到 Slave 上（failover）。但由于 Redis 的主从复制（replication）是异步的，这可能导致在 failover 过程中丧失锁的安全性。考虑下面的执行序列：\n\n客户端 1 从 Master 获取了锁。\nMaster 宕机了，存储锁的 key 还没有来得及同步到 Slave 上。\nSlave 升级为 Master。\n客户端 2 从新的 Master 获取到了对应同一个资源的锁。\n\n于是，客户端 1 和客户端 2 同时持有了同一个资源的锁。锁的安全性被打破。针对这个问题，antirez 设计了 Redlock 算法，我们接下来会讨论。\n【其它疑问】\n前面这个算法中出现的锁的有效时间 (lock validity time)，设置成多少合适呢？如果设置太短的话，锁就有可能在客户端完成对于共享资源的访问之前过期，从而失去保护；如果设置太长的话，一旦某个持有锁的客户端释放锁失败，那么就会导致所有其它客户端都无法获取锁，从而长时间内无法正常工作。看来真是个两难的问题。\n而且，在前面对于随机字符串my_random_value的分析中，antirez 也在文章中承认的确应该考虑客户端长期阻塞导致锁过期的情况。如果真的发生了这种情况，那么共享资源是不是已经失去了保护呢？antirez 重新设计的 Redlock 是否能解决这些问题呢？\n分布式锁 Redlock\n由于前面介绍的基于单 Redis 节点的分布式锁在 failover 的时候会产生解决不了的安全性问题，因此 antirez 提出了新的分布式锁的算法 Redlock，它基于 N 个完全独立的 Redis 节点（通常情况下 N 可以设置成 5）。\n运行 Redlock 算法的客户端依次执行下面各个步骤，来完成获取锁的操作：\n\n获取当前时间（毫秒数）。\n按顺序依次向 N 个 Redis 节点执行获取锁的操作。这个获取操作跟前面基于单 Redis 节点的获取锁的过程相同，包含随机字符串my_random_value，也包含过期时间（比如PX 30000，即锁的有效时间）。为了保证在某个 Redis 节点不可用的时候算法能够继续运行，这个获取锁的操作还有一个超时时间 (time out)，它要远小于锁的有效时间（几十毫秒量级）。客户端在向某个 Redis 节点获取锁失败以后，应该立即尝试下一个 Redis 节点。这里的失败，应该包含任何类型的失败，比如该 Redis 节点不可用，或者该 Redis 节点上的锁已经被其它客户端持有（注：Redlock 原文中这里只提到了 Redis 节点不可用的情况，但也应该包含其它的失败情况）。\n计算整个获取锁的过程总共消耗了多长时间，计算方法是用当前时间减去第 1 步记录的时间。如果客户端从大多数 Redis 节点（&gt;= N/2+1）成功获取到了锁，并且获取锁总共消耗的时间没有超过锁的有效时间 (lock validity time)，那么这时客户端才认为最终获取锁成功；否则，认为最终获取锁失败。\n如果最终获取锁成功了，那么这个锁的有效时间应该重新计算，它等于最初的锁的有效时间减去第 3 步计算出来的获取锁消耗的时间。\n如果最终获取锁失败了（可能由于获取到锁的 Redis 节点个数少于 N/2+1，或者整个获取锁的过程消耗的时间超过了锁的最初有效时间），那么客户端应该立即向所有 Redis 节点发起释放锁的操作（即前面介绍的 Redis Lua 脚本）。\n\n当然，上面描述的只是获取锁的过程，而释放锁的过程比较简单：客户端向所有 Redis 节点发起释放锁的操作，不管这些节点当时在获取锁的时候成功与否。\n由于 N 个 Redis 节点中的大多数能正常工作就能保证 Redlock 正常工作，因此理论上它的可用性更高。我们前面讨论的单 Redis 节点的分布式锁在 failover 的时候锁失效的问题，在 Redlock 中不存在了，但如果有节点发生崩溃重启，还是会对锁的安全性有影响的。具体的影响程度跟 Redis 对数据的持久化程度有关。\n假设一共有 5 个 Redis 节点：A, B, C, D, E。设想发生了如下的事件序列：\n\n客户端 1 成功锁住了 A, B, C，获取锁成功（但 D 和 E 没有锁住）。\n节点 C 崩溃重启了，但客户端 1 在 C 上加的锁没有持久化下来，丢失了。\n节点 C 重启后，客户端 2 锁住了 C, D, E，获取锁成功。\n\n这样，客户端 1 和客户端 2 同时获得了锁（针对同一资源）。\n在默认情况下，Redis 的 AOF 持久化方式是每秒写一次磁盘（即执行 fsync），因此最坏情况下可能丢失 1 秒的数据。为了尽可能不丢数据，Redis 允许设置成每次修改数据都进行 fsync，但这会降低性能。当然，即使执行了 fsync 也仍然有可能丢失数据（这取决于系统而不是 Redis 的实现）。所以，上面分析的由于节点重启引发的锁失效问题，总是有可能出现的。为了应对这一问题，antirez 又提出了延迟重启 (delayed restarts) 的概念。也就是说，一个节点崩溃后，先不立即重启它，而是等待一段时间再重启，这段时间应该大于锁的有效时间 (lock validity time)。这样的话，这个节点在重启前所参与的锁都会过期，它在重启后就不会对现有的锁造成影响。\n关于 Redlock 还有一点细节值得拿出来分析一下：在最后释放锁的时候，antirez 在算法描述中特别强调，客户端应该向所有 Redis 节点发起释放锁的操作。也就是说，即使当时向某个节点获取锁没有成功，在释放锁的时候也不应该漏掉这个节点。这是为什么呢？设想这样一种情况，客户端发给某个 Redis 节点的获取锁的请求成功到达了该 Redis 节点，这个节点也成功执行了SET操作，但是它返回给客户端的响应包却丢失了。这在客户端看来，获取锁的请求由于超时而失败了，但在 Redis 这边看来，加锁已经成功了。因此，释放锁的时候，客户端也应该对当时获取锁失败的那些 Redis 节点同样发起请求。实际上，这种情况在异步通信模型中是有可能发生的：客户端向服务器通信是正常的，但反方向却是有问题的。\n【其它疑问】\n前面在讨论单 Redis 节点的分布式锁的时候，最后我们提出了一个疑问，如果客户端长期阻塞导致锁过期，那么它接下来访问共享资源就不安全了（没有了锁的保护）。这个问题在 Redlock 中是否有所改善呢？显然，这样的问题在 Redlock 中是依然存在的。\n另外，在算法第 4 步成功获取了锁之后，如果由于获取锁的过程消耗了较长时间，重新计算出来的剩余的锁有效时间很短了，那么我们还来得及去完成共享资源访问吗？如果我们认为太短，是不是应该立即进行锁的释放操作？那到底多短才算呢？又是一个选择难题。\nMartin 的分析\nMartin Kleppmann 在 2016-02-08 这一天发表了一篇 blog，名字叫\"How to do distributed locking\"，地址如下：\n\nhttps://martin.kleppmann.com/2016/02/08/how-to-do-distributed-locking.html\n\nMartin 在这篇文章中谈及了分布式系统的很多基础性的问题（特别是分布式计算的异步模型），对分布式系统的从业者来说非常值得一读。这篇文章大体可以分为两大部分：\n\n前半部分，与 Redlock 无关。Martin 指出，即使我们拥有一个完美实现的分布式锁（带自动过期功能），在没有共享资源参与进来提供某种 fencing 机制的前提下，我们仍然不可能获得足够的安全性。\n后半部分，是对 Redlock 本身的批评。Martin 指出，由于 Redlock 本质上是建立在一个同步模型之上，对系统的记时假设 (timing assumption) 有很强的要求，因此本身的安全性是不够的。\n\n首先我们讨论一下前半部分的关键点。Martin 给出了下面这样一份时序图：\n\n在上面的时序图中，假设锁服务本身是没有问题的，它总是能保证任一时刻最多只有一个客户端获得锁。上图中出现的 lease 这个词可以暂且认为就等同于一个带有自动过期功能的锁。客户端 1 在获得锁之后发生了很长时间的 GC pause，在此期间，它获得的锁过期了，而客户端 2 获得了锁。当客户端 1 从 GC pause 中恢复过来的时候，它不知道自己持有的锁已经过期了，它依然向共享资源（上图中是一个存储服务）发起了写数据请求，而这时锁实际上被客户端 2 持有，因此两个客户端的写请求就有可能冲突（锁的互斥作用失效了）。\n初看上去，有人可能会说，既然客户端 1 从 GC pause 中恢复过来以后不知道自己持有的锁已经过期了，那么它可以在访问共享资源之前先判断一下锁是否过期。但仔细想想，这丝毫也没有帮助。因为 GC pause 可能发生在任意时刻，也许恰好在判断完之后。\n也有人会说，如果客户端使用没有 GC 的语言来实现，是不是就没有这个问题呢？Martin 指出，系统环境太复杂，仍然有很多原因导致进程的 pause，比如虚存造成的缺页故障 (page fault)，再比如 CPU 资源的竞争。即使不考虑进程 pause 的情况，网络延迟也仍然会造成类似的结果。\n总结起来就是说，即使锁服务本身是没有问题的，而仅仅是客户端有长时间的 pause 或网络延迟，仍然会造成两个客户端同时访问共享资源的冲突情况发生。而这种情况其实就是我们在前面已经提出来的“客户端长期阻塞导致锁过期”的那个疑问。\n那怎么解决这个问题呢？Martin 给出了一种方法，称为 fencing token。fencing token 是一个单调递增的数字，当客户端成功获取锁的时候它随同锁一起返回给客户端。而客户端访问共享资源的时候带着这个 fencing token，这样提供共享资源的服务就能根据它进行检查，拒绝掉延迟到来的访问请求（避免了冲突）。如下图：\n\n在上图中，客户端 1 先获取到的锁，因此有一个较小的 fencing token，等于 33，而客户端 2 后获取到的锁，有一个较大的 fencing token，等于 34。客户端 1 从 GC pause 中恢复过来之后，依然是向存储服务发送访问请求，但是带了 fencing token = 33。存储服务发现它之前已经处理过 34 的请求，所以会拒绝掉这次 33 的请求。这样就避免了冲突。\n现在我们再讨论一下 Martin 的文章的后半部分。\nMartin 在文中构造了一些事件序列，能够让 Redlock 失效（两个客户端同时持有锁）。为了说明 Redlock 对系统记时 (timing) 的过分依赖，他首先给出了下面的一个例子（还是假设有 5 个 Redis 节点 A, B, C, D, E）：\n\n客户端 1 从 Redis 节点 A, B, C 成功获取了锁（多数节点）。由于网络问题，与 D 和 E 通信失败。\n节点 C 上的时钟发生了向前跳跃，导致它上面维护的锁快速过期。\n客户端 2 从 Redis 节点 C, D, E 成功获取了同一个资源的锁（多数节点）。\n客户端 1 和客户端 2 现在都认为自己持有了锁。\n\n上面这种情况之所以有可能发生，本质上是因为 Redlock 的安全性 (safety property) 对系统的时钟有比较强的依赖，一旦系统的时钟变得不准确，算法的安全性也就保证不了了。Martin 在这里其实是要指出分布式算法研究中的一些基础性问题，或者说一些常识问题，即好的分布式算法应该基于异步模型 (asynchronous model)，算法的安全性不应该依赖于任何记时假设 (timing assumption)。在异步模型中：进程可能 pause 任意长的时间，消息可能在网络中延迟任意长的时间，甚至丢失，系统时钟也可能以任意方式出错。一个好的分布式算法，这些因素不应该影响它的安全性 (safety property)，只可能影响到它的活性 (liveness property)，也就是说，即使在非常极端的情况下（比如系统时钟严重错误），算法顶多是不能在有限的时间内给出结果而已，而不应该给出错误的结果。这样的算法在现实中是存在的，像比较著名的 Paxos，或 Raft。但显然按这个标准的话，Redlock 的安全性级别是达不到的。\n随后，Martin 觉得前面这个时钟跳跃的例子还不够，又给出了一个由客户端 GC pause 引发 Redlock 失效的例子。如下：\n\n客户端 1 向 Redis 节点 A, B, C, D, E 发起锁请求。\n各个 Redis 节点已经把请求结果返回给了客户端 1，但客户端 1 在收到请求结果之前进入了长时间的 GC pause。\n在所有的 Redis 节点上，锁过期了。\n客户端 2 在 A, B, C, D, E 上获取到了锁。\n客户端 1 从 GC pause 从恢复，收到了前面第 2 步来自各个 Redis 节点的请求结果。客户端 1 认为自己成功获取到了锁。\n客户端 1 和客户端 2 现在都认为自己持有了锁。\n\nMartin 给出的这个例子其实有点小问题。在 Redlock 算法中，客户端在完成向各个 Redis 节点的获取锁的请求之后，会计算这个过程消耗的时间，然后检查是不是超过了锁的有效时间 (lock validity time)。也就是上面的例子中第 5 步，客户端 1 从 GC pause 中恢复过来以后，它会通过这个检查发现锁已经过期了，不会再认为自己成功获取到锁了。随后 antirez 在他的反驳文章中就指出来了这个问题，但 Martin 认为这个细节对 Redlock 整体的安全性没有本质的影响。\n抛开这个细节，我们可以分析一下 Martin 举这个例子的意图在哪。初看起来，这个例子跟文章前半部分分析通用的分布式锁时给出的 GC pause 的时序图是基本一样的，只不过那里的 GC pause 发生在客户端 1 获得了锁之后，而这里的 GC pause 发生在客户端 1 获得锁之前。但两个例子的侧重点不太一样。Martin 构造这里的这个例子，是为了强调在一个分布式的异步环境下，长时间的 GC pause 或消息延迟（上面这个例子中，把 GC pause 换成 Redis 节点和客户端 1 之间的消息延迟，逻辑不变），会让客户端获得一个已经过期的锁。从客户端 1 的角度看，Redlock 的安全性被打破了，因为客户端 1 收到锁的时候，这个锁已经失效了，而 Redlock 同时还把这个锁分配给了客户端 2。换句话说，Redis 服务器在把锁分发给客户端的途中，锁就过期了，但又没有有效的机制让客户端明确知道这个问题。而在之前的那个例子中，客户端 1 收到锁的时候锁还是有效的，锁服务本身的安全性可以认为没有被打破，后面虽然也出了问题，但问题是出在客户端 1 和共享资源服务器之间的交互上。\n在 Martin 的这篇文章中，还有一个很有见地的观点，就是对锁的用途的区分。他把锁的用途分为两种：\n\n为了效率 (efficiency)，协调各个客户端避免做重复的工作。即使锁偶尔失效了，只是可能把某些操作多做一遍而已，不会产生其它的不良后果。比如重复发送了一封同样的 email。\n为了正确性 (correctness)。在任何情况下都不允许锁失效的情况发生，因为一旦发生，就可能意味着数据不一致 (inconsistency)，数据丢失，文件损坏，或者其它严重的问题。\n\n最后，Martin 得出了如下的结论：\n\n如果是为了效率 (efficiency) 而使用分布式锁，允许锁的偶尔失效，那么使用单 Redis 节点的锁方案就足够了，简单而且效率高。Redlock 则是个过重的实现 (heavyweight)。\n如果是为了正确性 (correctness) 在很严肃的场合使用分布式锁，那么不要使用 Redlock。它不是建立在异步模型上的一个足够强的算法，它对于系统模型的假设中包含很多危险的成分（对于 timing)。而且，它没有一个机制能够提供 fencing token。那应该使用什么技术呢？Martin 认为，应该考虑类似 Zookeeper 的方案，或者支持事务的数据库。\n\nMartin 对 Redlock 算法的形容是：\n\nneither fish nor fowl （非驴非马）\n\n【其它疑问】\n\nMartin 提出的 fencing token 的方案，需要对提供共享资源的服务进行修改，这在现实中可行吗？\n根据 Martin 的说法，看起来，如果资源服务器实现了 fencing token，它在分布式锁失效的情况下也仍然能保持资源的互斥访问。这是不是意味着分布式锁根本没有存在的意义了？\n资源服务器需要检查 fencing token 的大小，如果提供资源访问的服务也是包含多个节点的（分布式的），那么这里怎么检查才能保证 fencing token 在多个节点上是递增的呢？\nMartin 对于 fencing token 的举例中，两个 fencing token 到达资源服务器的顺序颠倒了（小的 fencing token 后到了），这时资源服务器检查出了这一问题。如果客户端 1 和客户端 2 都发生了 GC pause，两个 fencing token 都延迟了，它们几乎同时达到了资源服务器，但保持了顺序，那么资源服务器是不是就检查不出问题了？这时对于资源的访问是不是就发生冲突了？\n分布式锁+fencing 的方案是绝对正确的吗？能证明吗？\n\nantirez 的反驳\nMartin 在发表了那篇分析分布式锁的 blog (How to do distributed locking) 之后，该文章在 Twitter 和 Hacker News 上引发了广泛的讨论。但人们更想听到的是 Redlock 的作者 antirez 对此会发表什么样的看法。\nMartin 的那篇文章是在 2016-02-08 这一天发表的，但据 Martin 说，他在公开发表文章的一星期之前就把草稿发给了 antirez 进行 review，而且他们之间通过 email 进行了讨论。不知道 Martin 有没有意料到，antirez 对于此事的反应很快，就在 Martin 的文章发表出来的第二天，antirez 就在他的博客上贴出了他对于此事的反驳文章，名字叫\"Is Redlock safe?\"，地址如下：\n\nhttp://antirez.com/news/101\n\n这是高手之间的过招。antirez 这篇文章也条例非常清晰，并且中间涉及到大量的细节。antirez 认为，Martin 的文章对于 Redlock 的批评可以概括为两个方面（与 Martin 文章的前后两部分对应）：\n\n带有自动过期功能的分布式锁，必须提供某种 fencing 机制来保证对共享资源的真正的互斥保护。Redlock 提供不了这样一种机制。\nRedlock 构建在一个不够安全的系统模型之上。它对于系统的记时假设 (timing assumption) 有比较强的要求，而这些要求在现实的系统中是无法保证的。\n\nantirez 对这两方面分别进行了反驳。\n首先，关于 fencing 机制。antirez 对于 Martin 的这种论证方式提出了质疑：既然在锁失效的情况下已经存在一种 fencing 机制能继续保持资源的互斥访问了，那为什么还要使用一个分布式锁并且还要求它提供那么强的安全性保证呢？即使退一步讲，Redlock 虽然提供不了 Martin 所讲的递增的 fencing token，但利用 Redlock 产生的随机字符串 (my_random_value) 可以达到同样的效果。这个随机字符串虽然不是递增的，但却是唯一的，可以称之为 unique token。antirez 举了个例子，比如，你可以用它来实现“Check and Set”操作，原话是：\n\nWhen starting to work with a shared resource, we set its state to “&lt;token&gt;”, then we operate the read-modify-write only if the token is still the same when we write.（译文：当开始和共享资源交互的时候，我们将它的状态设置成“&lt;token&gt;”，然后仅在 token 没改变的情况下我们才执行“读取-修改-写回”操作。）\n\n第一遍看到这个描述的时候，我个人是感觉没太看懂的。“Check and Set”应该就是我们平常听到过的 CAS 操作了，但它如何在这个场景下工作，antirez 并没有展开说（在后面讲到 Hacker News 上的讨论的时候，我们还会提到）。\n然后，antirez 的反驳就集中在第二个方面上：关于算法在记时 (timing) 方面的模型假设。在我们前面分析 Martin 的文章时也提到过，Martin 认为 Redlock 会失效的情况主要有三种：\n\n时钟发生跳跃。\n长时间的 GC pause。\n长时间的网络延迟。\n\nantirez 肯定意识到了这三种情况对 Redlock 最致命的其实是第一点：时钟发生跳跃。这种情况一旦发生，Redlock 是没法正常工作的。而对于后两种情况来说，Redlock 在当初设计的时候已经考虑到了，对它们引起的后果有一定的免疫力。所以，antirez 接下来集中精力来说明通过恰当的运维，完全可以避免时钟发生大的跳动，而 Redlock 对于时钟的要求在现实系统中是完全可以满足的。\nMartin 在提到时钟跳跃的时候，举了两个可能造成时钟跳跃的具体例子：\n\n系统管理员手动修改了时钟。\n从 NTP 服务收到了一个大的时钟更新事件。\n\nantirez 反驳说：\n\n手动修改时钟这种人为原因，不要那么做就是了。否则的话，如果有人手动修改 Raft 协议的持久化日志，那么就算是 Raft 协议它也没法正常工作了。\n使用一个不会进行“跳跃”式调整系统时钟的 ntpd 程序（可能是通过恰当的配置），对于时钟的修改通过多次微小的调整来完成。\n\n而 Redlock 对时钟的要求，并不需要完全精确，它只需要时钟差不多精确就可以了。比如，要记时 5 秒，但可能实际记了 4.5 秒，然后又记了 5.5 秒，有一定的误差。不过只要误差不超过一定范围，这对 Redlock 不会产生影响。antirez 认为呢，像这样对时钟精度并不是很高的要求，在实际环境中是完全合理的。\n好了，到此为止，如果你相信 antirez 这里关于时钟的论断，那么接下来 antirez 的分析就基本上顺理成章了。\n关于 Martin 提到的能使 Redlock 失效的后两种情况，Martin 在分析的时候恰好犯了一个错误（在 本文上半部分 已经提到过）。在 Martin 给出的那个由客户端 GC pause 引发 Redlock 失效的例子中，这个 GC pause 引发的后果相当于在锁服务器和客户端之间发生了长时间的消息延迟。Redlock 对于这个情况是能处理的。回想一下 Redlock 算法的具体过程，它使用起来的过程大体可以分成 5 步：\n\n获取当前时间。\n完成获取锁的整个过程（与 N 个 Redis 节点交互）。\n再次获取当前时间。\n把两个时间相减，计算获取锁的过程是否消耗了太长时间，导致锁已经过期了。如果没过期，\n客户端持有锁去访问共享资源。\n\n在 Martin 举的例子中，GC pause 或网络延迟，实际发生在上述第 1 步和第 3 步之间。而不管在第 1 步和第 3 步之间由于什么原因（进程停顿或网络延迟等）导致了大的延迟出现，在第 4 步都能被检查出来，不会让客户端拿到一个它认为有效而实际却已经过期的锁。当然，这个检查依赖系统时钟没有大的跳跃。这也就是为什么 antirez 在前面要对时钟条件进行辩护的原因。\n有人会说，在第 3 步之后，仍然可能会发生延迟啊。没错，antirez 承认这一点，他对此有一段很有意思的论证，原话如下：\n\nThe delay can only happen after steps 3, resulting into the lock to be considered ok while actually expired, that is, we are back at the first problem Martin identified of distributed locks where the client fails to stop working to the shared resource before the lock validity expires. Let me tell again how this problem is common with all the distributed locks implementations, and how the token as a solution is both unrealistic and can be used with Redlock as well.（译文：延迟只能发生在第 3 步之后，这导致锁被认为是有效的而实际上已经过期了，也就是说，我们回到了 Martin 指出的第一个问题上，客户端没能够在锁的有效性过期之前完成与共享资源的交互。让我再次申明一下，这个问题对于所有的分布式锁的实现是普遍存在的，而且基于 token 的这种解决方案是不切实际的，但也能和 Redlock 一起用。）\n\n这里 antirez 所说的“Martin 指出的第一个问题”具体是什么呢？在 本文上半部分 我们提到过，Martin 的文章分为两大部分，其中前半部分与 Redlock 没有直接关系，而是指出了任何一种带自动过期功能的分布式锁在没有提供 fencing 机制的前提下都有可能失效。这里 antirez 所说的就是指的 Martin 的文章的前半部分。换句话说，对于大延迟给 Redlock 带来的影响，恰好与 Martin 在文章的前半部分针对所有的分布式锁所做的分析是一致的，而这种影响不单单针对 Redlock。Redlock 的实现已经保证了它是和其它任何分布式锁的安全性是一样的。当然，与其它“更完美”的分布式锁相比，Redlock 似乎提供不了 Martin 提出的那种递增的 token，但 antirez 在前面已经分析过了，关于 token 的这种论证方式本身就是“不切实际”的，或者退一步讲，Redlock 能提供的 unique token 也能够提供完全一样的效果。\n另外，关于大延迟对 Redlock 的影响，antirez 和 Martin 在 Twitter 上有下面的对话：\n\nantirez:@martinkl so I wonder if after my reply, we can at least agree about unbound messages delay to don’t cause any harm.\nMartin:@antirez Agree about message delay between app and lock server. Delay between app and resource being accessed is still problematic.\n（译文：antirez 问：我想知道，在我发文回复之后，我们能否在一点上达成一致，就是大的消息延迟不会给 Redlock 的运行造成损害。Martin 答：对于客户端和锁服务器之间的消息延迟，我同意你的观点。但客户端和被访问资源之间的延迟还是有问题的。）\n\n通过这段对话可以看出，对于 Redlock 在第 4 步所做的锁有效性的检查，Martin 是予以肯定的。但他认为客户端和资源服务器之间的延迟还是会带来问题的。Martin 在这里说的有点模糊。就像 antirez 前面分析的，客户端和资源服务器之间的延迟，对所有的分布式锁的实现都会带来影响，这不单单是 Redlock 的问题了。\n以上就是 antirez 在 blog 中所说的主要内容。有一些点值得我们注意一下：\n\nantirez 是同意大的系统时钟跳跃会造成 Redlock 失效的。在这一点上，他与 Martin 的观点的不同在于，他认为在实际系统中是可以避免大的时钟跳跃的。当然，这取决于基础设施和运维方式。\nantirez 在设计 Redlock 的时候，是充分考虑了网络延迟和程序停顿所带来的影响的。但是，对于客户端和资源服务器之间的延迟（即发生在算法第 3 步之后的延迟），antirez 是承认所有的分布式锁的实现，包括 Redlock，是没有什么好办法来应对的。\n\n讨论进行到这，Martin 和 antirez 之间谁对谁错其实并不是那么重要了。只要我们能够对 Redlock（或者其它分布式锁）所能提供的安全性的程度有充分的了解，那么我们就能做出自己的选择了。\nHacker News 上的一些讨论\n针对 Martin 和 antirez 的两篇 blog，很多技术人员在 Hacker News 上展开了激烈的讨论。这些讨论所在地址如下：\n\n针对 Martin 的 blog 的讨论：https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11059738\n针对 antirez 的 blog 的讨论：https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11065933\n\n在 Hacker News 上，antirez 积极参与了讨论，而 Martin 则始终置身事外。\n下面我把这些讨论中一些有意思的点拿出来与大家一起分享一下（集中在对于 fencing token 机制的讨论上）。\n关于 antirez 提出的“Check and Set”操作，他在 blog 里并没有详加说明。果然，在 Hacker News 上就有人出来问了。antirez 给出的答复如下：\n\nYou want to modify locked resource X. You set X.currlock = token. Then you read, do whatever you want, and when you write, you \"write-if-currlock == token\". If another client did X.currlock = somethingelse, the transaction fails.\n\n翻译一下可以这样理解：假设你要修改资源 X，那么遵循下面的伪码所定义的步骤。\n\n先设置 X.currlock = token。\n读出资源 X（包括它的值和附带的 X.currlock）。\n按照\"write-if-currlock == token\"的逻辑，修改资源 X 的值。意思是说，如果对 X 进行修改的时候，X.currlock 仍然和当初设置进去的 token 相等，那么才进行修改；如果这时 X.currlock 已经是其它值了，那么说明有另外一方也在试图进行修改操作，那么放弃当前的修改，从而避免冲突。\n\n随后 Hacker News 上一位叫 viraptor 的用户提出了异议，它给出了这样一个执行序列：\n\nA: X.currlock = Token_ID_A\nA: resource read\nA: is X.currlock still Token_ID_A? yes\nB: X.currlock = Token_ID_B\nB: resource read\nB: is X.currlock still Token_ID_B? yes\nB: resource write\nA: resource write\n\n到了最后两步，两个客户端 A 和 B 同时进行写操作，冲突了。不过，这位用户应该是理解错了 antirez 给出的修改过程了。按照 antirez 的意思，判断 X.currlock 是否修改过和对资源的写操作，应该是一个原子操作。只有这样理解才能合乎逻辑，否则的话，这个过程就有严重的破绽。这也是为什么 antirez 之前会对 fencing 机制产生质疑：既然资源服务器本身都能提供互斥的原子操作了，为什么还需要一个分布式锁呢？因此，antirez 认为这种 fencing 机制是很累赘的，他之所以还是提出了这种“Check and Set”操作，只是为了证明在提供 fencing token 这一点上，Redlock 也能做到。但是，这里仍然有一些不明确的地方，如果将\"write-if-currlock == token\"看做是原子操作的话，这个逻辑势必要在资源服务器上执行，那么第二步为什么还要“读出资源 X”呢？除非这个“读出资源 X”的操作也是在资源服务器上执行，它包含在“判断-写回”这个原子操作里面。而假如不这样理解的话，“读取-判断-写回”这三个操作都放在客户端执行，那么看不出它们如何才能实现原子性操作。在下面的讨论中，我们暂时忽略“读出资源 X”这一步。\n这个基于 random token 的“Check and Set”操作，如果与 Martin 提出的递增的 fencing token 对比一下的话，至少有两点不同：\n\n“Check and Set”对于写操作要分成两步来完成（设置 token、判断-写回），而递增的 fencing token 机制只需要一步（带着 token 向资源服务器发起写请求）。\n递增的 fencing token 机制能保证最终操作共享资源的顺序，那些延迟时间太长的操作就无法操作共享资源了。但是基于 random token 的“Check and Set”操作不会保证这个顺序，那些延迟时间太长的操作如果后到达了，它仍然有可能操作共享资源（当然是以互斥的方式）。\n\n对于前一点不同，我们在后面的分析中会看到，如果资源服务器也是分布式的，那么使用递增的 fencing token 也要变成两步。\n而对于后一点操作顺序上的不同，antirez 认为这个顺序没有意义，关键是能互斥访问就行了。他写下了下面的话：\n\nSo the goal is, when race conditions happen, to avoid them in some way.......Note also that when it happens that, because of delays, the clients are accessing concurrently, the lock ID has little to do with the order in which the operations were indented to happen.（译文： 我们的目标是，当竞争条件出现的时候，能够以某种方式避免。...... 还需要注意的是，当那种竞争条件出现的时候，比如由于延迟，客户端是同时来访问的，锁的 ID 的大小顺序跟那些操作真正想执行的顺序，是没有什么关系的。）\n\n这里的 lock ID，跟 Martin 说的递增的 token 是一回事。\n随后，antirez 举了一个“将名字加入列表”的操作的例子：\n\nT0: Client A receives new name to add from web.\nT0: Client B is idle\nT1: Client A is experiencing pauses.\nT1: Client B receives new name to add from web.\nT2: Client A is experiencing pauses.\nT2: Client B receives a lock with ID 1\nT3: Client A receives a lock with ID 2\n\n你看，两个客户端（其实是 Web 服务器）执行“添加名字”的操作，A 本来是排在 B 前面的，但获得锁的顺序却是 B 排在 A 前面。因此，antirez 说，锁的 ID 的大小顺序跟那些操作真正想执行的顺序，是没有什么关系的。关键是能排出一个顺序来，能互斥访问就行了。那么，至于锁的 ID 是递增的，还是一个 random token，自然就不那么重要了。\nMartin 提出的 fencing token 机制，给人留下了无尽的疑惑。这主要是因为他对于这一机制的描述缺少太多的技术细节。从上面的讨论可以看出，antirez 对于这一机制的看法是，它跟一个 random token 没有什么区别，而且，它需要资源服务器本身提供某种互斥机制，这几乎让分布式锁本身的存在失去了意义。围绕 fencing token 的问题，还有两点是比较引人注目的，Hacker News 上也有人提出了相关的疑问：\n\n（1）关于资源服务器本身的架构细节。\n（2）资源服务器对于 fencing token 进行检查的实现细节，比如是否需要提供一种原子操作。\n\n关于上述问题（1），Hacker News 上有一位叫 dwenzek 的用户发表了下面的评论：\n\n...... the issue around the usage of fencing tokens to reject any late usage of a lock is unclear just because the protected resource and its access are themselves unspecified. Is the resource distributed or not? If distributed, does the resource has a mean to ensure that tokens are increasing over all the nodes? Does the resource have a mean to rollback any effects done by a client which session is interrupted by a timeout?\n（译文：...... 关于使用 fencing token 拒绝掉延迟请求的相关议题，是不够清晰的，因为受保护的资源以及对它的访问方式本身是没有被明确定义过的。资源服务是不是分布式的呢？如果是，资源服务有没有一种方式能确保 token 在所有节点上递增呢？对于客户端的 Session 由于过期而被中断的情况，资源服务有办法将它的影响回滚吗？）\n\n这些疑问在 Hacker News 上并没有人给出解答。而关于分布式的资源服务器架构如何处理 fencing token，另外一名分布式系统的专家 Flavio Junqueira 在他的一篇 blog 中有所提及（我们后面会再提到）。\n关于上述问题（2），Hacker News 上有一位叫 reza_n 的用户发表了下面的疑问：\n\nI understand how a fencing token can prevent out of order writes when 2 clients get the same lock. But what happens when those writes happen to arrive in order and you are doing a value modification? Don't you still need to rely on some kind of value versioning or optimistic locking? Wouldn't this make the use of a distributed lock unnecessary?\n（译文： 我理解当两个客户端同时获得锁的时候 fencing token 是如何防止乱序的。但是如果两个写操作恰好按序到达了，而且它们在对同一个值进行修改，那会发生什么呢？难道不会仍然是依赖某种数据版本号或者乐观锁的机制？这不会让分布式锁变得没有必要了吗？）\n\n一位叫 Terr_的 Hacker News 用户答：\n\nI believe the \"first\" write fails, because the token being passed in is no longer \"the lastest\", which indicates their lock was already released or expired.\n（译文： 我认为“第一个”写请求会失败，因为它传入的 token 不再是“最新的”了，这意味着锁已经释放或者过期了。）\n\nTerr_的回答到底对不对呢？这不好说，取决于资源服务器对于 fencing token 进行检查的实现细节。让我们来简单分析一下。\n为了简单起见，我们假设有一台（先不考虑分布式的情况）通过 RPC 进行远程访问文件服务器，它无法提供对于文件的互斥访问（否则我们就不需要分布式锁了）。现在我们按照 Martin 给出的说法，加入 fencing token 的检查逻辑。由于 Martin 没有描述具体细节，我们猜测至少有两种可能。\n第一种可能，我们修改了文件服务器的代码，让它能多接受一个 fencing token 的参数，并在进行所有处理之前加入了一个简单的判断逻辑，保证只有当前接收到的 fencing token 大于之前的值才允许进行后边的访问。而一旦通过了这个判断，后面的处理不变。\n现在想象 reza_n 描述的场景，客户端 1 和客户端 2 都发生了 GC pause，两个 fencing token 都延迟了，它们几乎同时到达了文件服务器，而且保持了顺序。那么，我们新加入的判断逻辑，应该对两个请求都会放过，而放过之后它们几乎同时在操作文件，还是冲突了。既然 Martin 宣称 fencing token 能保证分布式锁的正确性，那么上面这种可能的猜测也许是我们理解错了。\n当然，还有第二种可能，就是我们对文件服务器确实做了比较大的改动，让这里判断 token 的逻辑和随后对文件的处理放在一个原子操作里了。这可能更接近 antirez 的理解。这样的话，前面 reza_n 描述的场景中，两个写操作都应该成功。\n基于 ZooKeeper 的分布式锁更安全吗？\n很多人（也包括 Martin 在内）都认为，如果你想构建一个更安全的分布式锁，那么应该使用 ZooKeeper，而不是 Redis。那么，为了对比的目的，让我们先暂时脱离开本文的题目，讨论一下基于 ZooKeeper 的分布式锁能提供绝对的安全吗？它需要 fencing token 机制的保护吗？\n我们不得不提一下分布式专家 Flavio Junqueira 所写的一篇 blog，题目叫“Note on fencing and distributed locks”，地址如下：\n\nhttps://fpj.me/2016/02/10/note-on-fencing-and-distributed-locks/\n\nFlavio Junqueira 是 ZooKeeper 的作者之一，他的这篇 blog 就写在 Martin 和 antirez 发生争论的那几天。他在文中给出了一个基于 ZooKeeper 构建分布式锁的描述（当然这不是唯一的方式）：\n\n客户端尝试创建一个 znode 节点，比如/lock。那么第一个客户端就创建成功了，相当于拿到了锁；而其它的客户端会创建失败（znode 已存在），获取锁失败。\n持有锁的客户端访问共享资源完成后，将 znode 删掉，这样其它客户端接下来就能来获取锁了。\nznode 应该被创建成 ephemeral 的。这是 znode 的一个特性，它保证如果创建 znode 的那个客户端崩溃了，那么相应的 znode 会被自动删除。这保证了锁一定会被释放。\n\n看起来这个锁相当完美，没有 Redlock 过期时间的问题，而且能在需要的时候让锁自动释放。但仔细考察的话，并不尽然。\nZooKeeper 是怎么检测出某个客户端已经崩溃了呢？实际上，每个客户端都与 ZooKeeper 的某台服务器维护着一个 Session，这个 Session 依赖定期的心跳 (heartbeat) 来维持。如果 ZooKeeper 长时间收不到客户端的心跳（这个时间称为 Sesion 的过期时间），那么它就认为 Session 过期了，通过这个 Session 所创建的所有的 ephemeral 类型的 znode 节点都会被自动删除。\n设想如下的执行序列：\n\n客户端 1 创建了 znode 节点/lock，获得了锁。\n客户端 1 进入了长时间的 GC pause。\n客户端 1 连接到 ZooKeeper 的 Session 过期了。znode 节点/lock被自动删除。\n客户端 2 创建了 znode 节点/lock，从而获得了锁。\n客户端 1 从 GC pause 中恢复过来，它仍然认为自己持有锁。\n\n最后，客户端 1 和客户端 2 都认为自己持有了锁，冲突了。这与之前 Martin 在文章中描述的由于 GC pause 导致的分布式锁失效的情况类似。\n看起来，用 ZooKeeper 实现的分布式锁也不一定就是安全的。该有的问题它还是有。但是，ZooKeeper 作为一个专门为分布式应用提供方案的框架，它提供了一些非常好的特性，是 Redis 之类的方案所没有的。像前面提到的 ephemeral 类型的 znode 自动删除的功能就是一个例子。\n还有一个很有用的特性是 ZooKeeper 的 watch 机制。这个机制可以这样来使用，比如当客户端试图创建/lock的时候，发现它已经存在了，这时候创建失败，但客户端不一定就此对外宣告获取锁失败。客户端可以进入一种等待状态，等待当/lock节点被删除的时候，ZooKeeper 通过 watch 机制通知它，这样它就可以继续完成创建操作（获取锁）。这可以让分布式锁在客户端用起来就像一个本地的锁一样：加锁失败就阻塞住，直到获取到锁为止。这样的特性 Redlock 就无法实现。\n小结一下，基于 ZooKeeper 的锁和基于 Redis 的锁相比在实现特性上有两个不同：\n\n在正常情况下，客户端可以持有锁任意长的时间，这可以确保它做完所有需要的资源访问操作之后再释放锁。这避免了基于 Redis 的锁对于有效时间 (lock validity time) 到底设置多长的两难问题。实际上，基于 ZooKeeper 的锁是依靠 Session（心跳）来维持锁的持有状态的，而 Redis 不支持 Sesion。\n基于 ZooKeeper 的锁支持在获取锁失败之后等待锁重新释放的事件。这让客户端对锁的使用更加灵活。\n\n顺便提一下，如上所述的基于 ZooKeeper 的分布式锁的实现，并不是最优的。它会引发“herd effect”（羊群效应），降低获取锁的性能。一个更好的实现参见下面链接：\n\nhttp://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.4.9/recipes.html#sc_recipes_Locks\n\n我们重新回到 Flavio Junqueira 对于 fencing token 的分析。Flavio Junqueira 指出，fencing token 机制本质上是要求客户端在每次访问一个共享资源的时候，在执行任何操作之前，先对资源进行某种形式的“标记”(mark) 操作，这个“标记”能保证持有旧的锁的客户端请求（如果延迟到达了）无法操作资源。这种标记操作可以是很多形式，fencing token 是其中比较典型的一个。\n随后 Flavio Junqueira 提到用递增的 epoch number（相当于 Martin 的 fencing token）来保护共享资源。而对于分布式的资源，为了方便讨论，假设分布式资源是一个小型的多备份的数据存储 (a small replicated data store)，执行写操作的时候需要向所有节点上写数据。最简单的做标记的方式，就是在对资源进行任何操作之前，先把 epoch number 标记到各个资源节点上去。这样，各个节点就保证了旧的（也就是小的）epoch number 无法操作数据。\n当然，这里再展开讨论下去可能就涉及到了这个数据存储服务的实现细节了。比如在实际系统中，可能为了容错，只要上面讲的标记和写入操作在多数节点上完成就算成功完成了（Flavio Junqueira 并没有展开去讲）。在这里我们能看到的，最重要的，是这种标记操作如何起作用的方式。这有点类似于 Paxos 协议（Paxos 协议要求每个 proposal 对应一个递增的数字，执行 accept 请求之前先执行 prepare 请求）。antirez 提出的 random token 的方式显然不符合 Flavio Junqueira 对于“标记”操作的定义，因为它无法区分新的 token 和旧的 token。只有递增的数字才能确保最终收敛到最新的操作结果上。\n在这个分布式数据存储服务（共享资源）的例子中，客户端在标记完成之后执行写入操作的时候，存储服务的节点需要判断 epoch number 是不是最新，然后确定能不能执行写入操作。如果按照上一节我们的分析思路，这里的 epoch 判断和接下来的写入操作，是不是在一个原子操作里呢？根据 Flavio Junqueira 的相关描述，我们相信，应该是原子的。那么既然资源本身可以提供原子互斥操作了，那么分布式锁还有存在的意义吗？应该说有。客户端可以利用分布式锁有效地避免冲突，等待写入机会，这对于包含多个节点的分布式资源尤其有用（当然，是出于效率的原因）。\nChubby 的分布式锁是怎样做 fencing 的？\n提到分布式锁，就不能不提 Google 的 Chubby。\nChubby 是 Google 内部使用的分布式锁服务，有点类似于 ZooKeeper，但也存在很多差异。Chubby 对外公开的资料，主要是一篇论文，叫做“The Chubby lock service for loosely-coupled distributed systems”，下载地址如下：\n\nhttps://research.google.com/archive/chubby.html\n\n另外，YouTube 上有一个的讲 Chubby 的 talk，也很不错，播放地址：\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqItueBaiRg&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=487\n\nChubby 自然也考虑到了延迟造成的锁失效的问题。论文里有一段描述如下：\n\na process holding a lock L may issue a request R, but then fail. Another process may ac- quire L and perform some action before R arrives at its destination. If R later arrives, it may be acted on without the protection of L, and potentially on inconsistent data.\n（译文： 一个进程持有锁 L，发起了请求 R，但是请求失败了。另一个进程获得了锁 L 并在请求 R 到达目的方之前执行了一些动作。如果后来请求 R 到达了，它就有可能在没有锁 L 保护的情况下进行操作，带来数据不一致的潜在风险。）\n\n这跟 Martin 的分析大同小异。\nChubby 给出的用于解决（缓解）这一问题的机制称为 sequencer，类似于 fencing token 机制。锁的持有者可以随时请求一个 sequencer，这是一个字节串，它由三部分组成：\n\n锁的名字。\n锁的获取模式（排他锁还是共享锁）。\nlock generation number（一个 64bit 的单调递增数字）。作用相当于 fencing token 或 epoch number。\n\n客户端拿到 sequencer 之后，在操作资源的时候把它传给资源服务器。然后，资源服务器负责对 sequencer 的有效性进行检查。检查可以有两种方式：\n\n调用 Chubby 提供的 API，CheckSequencer()，将整个 sequencer 传进去进行检查。这个检查是为了保证客户端持有的锁在进行资源访问的时候仍然有效。\n将客户端传来的 sequencer 与资源服务器当前观察到的最新的 sequencer 进行对比检查。可以理解为与 Martin 描述的对于 fencing token 的检查类似。\n\n当然，如果由于兼容的原因，资源服务本身不容易修改，那么 Chubby 还提供了一种机制：\n\nlock-delay。Chubby 允许客户端为持有的锁指定一个 lock-delay 的时间值（默认是 1 分钟）。当 Chubby 发现客户端被动失去联系的时候，并不会立即释放锁，而是会在 lock-delay 指定的时间内阻止其它客户端获得这个锁。这是为了在把锁分配给新的客户端之前，让之前持有锁的客户端有充分的时间把请求队列排空 (draining the queue)，尽量防止出现延迟到达的未处理请求。\n\n可见，为了应对锁失效问题，Chubby 提供的三种处理方式：CheckSequencer() 检查、与上次最新的 sequencer 对比、lock-delay，它们对于安全性的保证是从强到弱的。而且，这些处理方式本身都没有保证提供绝对的正确性 (correctness)。但是，Chubby 确实提供了单调递增的 lock generation number，这就允许资源服务器在需要的时候，利用它提供更强的安全性保障。\n关于时钟\n在 Martin 与 antirez 的这场争论中，冲突最为严重的就是对于系统时钟的假设是不是合理的问题。Martin 认为系统时钟难免会发生跳跃（这与分布式算法的异步模型相符），而 antirez 认为在实际中系统时钟可以保证不发生大的跳跃。\nMartin 对于这一分歧发表了如下看法（原话）：\n\nSo, fundamentally, this discussion boils down to whether it is reasonable to make timing assumptions for ensuring safety properties. I say no, Salvatore says yes — but that's ok. Engineering discussions rarely have one right answer.\n（译文：从根本上来说，这场讨论最后归结到了一个问题上：为了确保安全性而做出的记时假设到底是否合理。我认为不合理，而 antirez 认为合理 —— 但是这也没关系。工程问题的讨论很少只有一个正确答案。）\n\n那么，在实际系统中，时钟到底是否可信呢？对此，Julia Evans 专门写了一篇文章，“TIL: clock skew exists”，总结了很多跟时钟偏移有关的实际资料，并进行了分析。这篇文章地址：\n\nhttp://jvns.ca/blog/2016/02/09/til-clock-skew-exists/\n\nJulia Evans 在文章最后得出的结论是：\n\nclock skew is real（时钟偏移在现实中是存在的）\n\n关于分布式锁的这场争论，我们已经完整地做了回顾和分析。\n按照锁的两种用途，如果仅是为了效率 (efficiency)，那么你可以自己选择你喜欢的一种分布式锁的实现。当然，你需要清楚地知道它在安全性上有哪些不足，以及它会带来什么后果。而如果你是为了正确性 (correctness)，那么请慎之又慎。在本文的讨论中，我们在分布式锁的正确性上走得最远的地方，要数对于 ZooKeeper 分布式锁、单调递增的 epoch number 以及对分布式资源进行标记的分析了。请仔细审查相关的论证。\nMartin 为我们留下了不少疑问，尤其是他提出的 fencing token 机制。他在 blog 中提到，会在他的新书《Designing Data-Intensive Applications》的第 8 章和第 9 章再详加论述。目前，这本书尚在预售当中。我感觉，这会是一本值得一读的书，它不同于为了出名或赚钱而出版的那种短平快的书籍。可以看出作者在这本书上投入了巨大的精力。\n最后，我相信，这个讨论还远没有结束。分布式锁 (Distributed Locks) 和相应的 fencing 方案，可以作为一个长期的课题，随着我们对分布式系统的认识逐渐增加，可以再来慢慢地思考它。思考它更深层的本质，以及它在理论上的证明。\n","id":"https://wendajiang.github.io/redis-distribute-lock/","title":"Redis 分布式锁 [翻译]"},"https://wendajiang.github.io/reservoir-sampling/":{"body":"\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir_sampling\n蓄水池采样是随机算法中选择一次随机采样的算法，从未知数据规模中挑选一次采样的算法。算法不知道数据的规模 n，并且算法不存储过去的数值，只能在当前的数中作出选择--选还是不选。\n动机\n假设我们看到一个序列，一次看到序列的一项。我们想要将10项存储在内存中，然后从10项中随机挑选出1项。如果我们知道序列的大小n，即一共有多少项，这很容易，问题是我们不知道n的大小。\n简单算法\n简单但是比较慢的算法，被称为 Aligorithm R\nReservoirSample(S[1...n], R[1...k])\n\t// fill the reservoir array\n\tfor i := 1 to k\n    R[i] := S[i]\n  \n  for i := k + 1 to n\n    j := randomInteger(1, i)\n    if j &lt;= k\n    \tR[j] := S[i]\n\n该算法建立了 size k 的蓄水池，开始保存输入的 k项。随着输入的迭代，按照条件更新蓄水池。对于第$i^{th}$元素来说，被选上的概率为 $\\frac{k}{i}$。对于蓄水池的项，被代替的概率为 $ \\frac{1}{k} \\times \\frac{k}{i} = \\frac{1}{i} $。当算法结束时，每个输入项被选到蓄水池的概率相等$\\frac{k}{n}$ （$\\frac{k}{i} \\times (1 - \\frac{1}{i+1}) \\times (1 - \\frac{1}{i + 2}) \\times ... \\times (1 - \\frac{1}{n}) = \\frac{k}{n}$），算法时间复杂度为 O(n)\n一个优化算法\nAlgorithm L 优化了这个算法，通过计算下一个item进入蓄水池之前已经丢弃了多少项。关键点在于这个值满足几何分布，因此可以在常数时间计算\n/* S has items to sample, R will contain the result */\nReservoirSample(S[1..n], R[1..k])\n  // fill the reservoir array\n  for i = 1 to k\n      R[i] := S[i]\n\n  /* random() generates a uniform (0,1) random number */\n  W := exp(log(random())/k)\n\n  while i &lt;= n\n      i := i + floor(log(random())/log(1-W)) + 1\n      if i &lt;= n\n          /* replace a random item of the reservoir with item i */\n          R[randomInteger(1,k)] := S[i]  // random index between 1 and k, inclusive\n          W := W * exp(log(random())/k)\n\n这个算法在不会被选中的项上不花时间，算法时间复杂度为 O(k(1 + log(n/k)))\n随机排序(Reservoir Sampling with Radnom Sort)\n如果将输入的每项绑定其对应的随机数，然后在选中的k项中看随机数大小取用，比如选随机数最大的，可以通过优先队列维护k的蓄水池\n/*\n  S is a stream of items to sample\n  S.Current returns current item in stream\n  S.Next advances stream to next position\n  min-priority-queue supports:\n    Count -&gt; number of items in priority queue\n    Minimum -&gt; returns minimum key value of all items\n    Extract-Min() -&gt; Remove the item with minimum key\n    Insert(key, Item) -&gt; Adds item with specified key\n */\nReservoirSample(S[1..?])\n  H := new min-priority-queue\n  while S has data\n    r := random()   // uniformly random between 0 and 1, exclusive\n    if H.Count &lt; k\n      H.Insert(r, S.Current)\n    else\n      // keep k items with largest associated keys\n      if r &gt; H.Minimum\n        H.Extract-Min()\n        H.Insert(r, S.Current)\n    S.Next\n  return items in H\n\n期望复杂度为 O(n + klogklog(n/k)) ，这个算法意义在于容易扩展到有权重的item\n权重蓄水池\nSome applications require items' sampling probabilities to be according to weights associated with each item. For example, it might be required to sample queries in a search engine with weight as number of times they were performed so that the sample can be analyzed for overall impact on user experience. Let the weight of item i be $$, and the sum of all weights be W. There are two ways to interpret weights assigned to each item in the set:[4]\n\nIn each round, the probability of every unselected item to be selected in that round is proportional to its weight relative to the weights of all unselected items. If X is the current sample, then the probability of an item $i \\notin X$ to be selected in the current round is $\\frac{w_i}{W - \\sum_{j \\in X}w_j}$\nThe probability of each item to be included in the random sample is proportional to its relative weight, i.e. $\\frac{w_i}{W}$.

只能近似总结这多种应用。更加精确的表达是，我开发的应用被设计为每秒处理大量分离消息或者请求。网络服务器最适合描述这种应用，但是不是所有的应用都在服务端。因此为了简化处理，因为 \"高性能请求处理程序\" 这个标题太蠢了，我们只用 “server” 代称好了。\n我关注的不是轻量级并发应用，即使在单个应用上多任务处理已经相当普遍。你正在阅读这篇文章的浏览器就是并行处理程序，但是这种程度的并发不存在很多有趣的挑战。当请求处理程序达到基础设施性能瓶颈的时候会出现很多有趣的挑战，所以提升基础设施容量可以提升性能。浏览器运行几个 tab 不会达到这种限制。这篇文章关注的重点不在于小流量的应用，而在于大流量的应用，如何在硬件限制下做到这一点很重要。\n有些人肯定会对我的建议产生异议，或者认为他们有更好的方案。没问题，我不是想成为完全正确的声音，这些只是我工作过程中总结的方法，不仅包括性能方面，还包括调试难度和代码可扩展性。你的经验可能是不一样的，如果有什么可以对你产生帮助那再好不过，但请注意，这里的建议确实都可以用其他方式来代替，我也曾经尝试过，你的故事可能就是其中之一，如果你觉得应该展示出来，读者可能会很无聊。你不想伤害他们，对吗？\n文章的剩余部分分为四个主要部分：\n\n数据复制\n上下文切换\n内存分配\n锁竞争\n\n最后还有一些细枝末节的内容，但是上面的四个部分才是性能杀手。如果你处理请求的应用没有数据拷贝，没有上下文切换，没有频繁的内存分配，没有锁竞争，即使有一些其他的小问题，服务也会有很好的性能。\n数据复制\n这部分比较短，因为大多数人已经了解过这个方面了。每个人都知道数据拷贝不好，对吧。但是事实上，这个显然性是因为你很早就在计算机的相关课程中学习到了这部分内容，而这知识因为几十年前有人开始提出这个词发生的。如今，它已经覆盖在每个学校的课程和每个非正式的指南中，同时市场发现 \"zero copy\" 是一个很好的流行语。\n尽管数据拷贝显然是坏的，人们还是会经常忽略这个问题。最重要的一点是数据拷贝通常是隐式的或者伪装的。你确定你的代码在调用驱动程序或者其他代码的时候是否会进行数据拷贝吗？可能会比你想象的多。猜猜 programmed I/O 表示什么。一个伪装而不是隐式的例子是 hash function，它有所有拷贝数据的访问操作以及计算。一旦有人指出 hash 存在复制，显然需要避免它，据我所知，有一群聪明人通过艰难的方式解决这个问题。如果你真的想要解决数据拷贝，要么是因为确实损害到了你应用的性能，要么是你在你的 ppt 上要写 zero copy ，你需要追踪很多东西并不宣传它们。\n避免数据拷贝的方法是使用间接性，传递 buffer 的描述，而不是仅仅 buffer 指针。每个 buffer 描述包括：\n\n指针以及指针指向 buffer 的长度\n指针和长度，或者 offset 和长度，描述 buffer 真正被填充的部分\nlist 中前向和后向的 buffer 描述\n引用计数\n\n现在不需要拷贝数据，只需要增加引用计数。这可以在一些场景下工作的很好，包括典型的网络协议栈，但是这需要较大的头部空间。通常来说，在 list 的头和尾增加 buffer ，臧家整个 buffer 的引用，或者销毁整个 buffer 是容易的。在中间增加，销毁，或者引用部分 buffer 是比较困难的。尝试分割合并 buffer 会使你感到沮丧。\n我不建议你在所有场景应用这种方法。为什么？因为当你要遍历所有的描述链时会很痛苦，这比数据复制更糟糕。我发现最好的方法是在程序中标示大对象，然后单独分配管理，也不用复制，也不用跟其他数据一起管理。\n最后一个关于数据拷贝的观点：不要过度优化。我看到过为了避免数据拷贝导致代码更糟糕的例子，比如强制上下文切换或者打断一个大的 I/O 请求。数据拷贝是昂贵的，当你觉得需要优化性能时确实应该优先考虑它，但是要有一个度，如果为了避免很少的数据拷贝导致代码复杂了一倍，这是得不偿失的。\n上下文切换\n对比每个人都知道数据拷贝是糟糕的，我非常惊讶的发现人们对于上下文切换消耗的性能的忽视。在我的经验中，上下文切换会导致比数据拷贝更加的性能暴跌，系统开始花费大量的时间从一个线程切换到另一个而不是做一些具体的工作。惊奇的事情就是，在某种层面，导致过度上下文切换的原因是显而易见的。第一种情况就是工作线程数量大于处理器数量。随着线程数比处理器数的提高，上下文切换的次数也在提升，如果幸运的话这是线性的，但是通常是指数的。这个简单事实解释了为了每个连接都新建一个线程的设计为什么可扩展性很差。可扩展系统的唯一现实选择是限制活动线程数量，使其小于或者等于处理器数量。这种方法的一个流行变体是只使用一个线程，虽然这种方法确实避免了上下文抖动，也避免了使用锁，同时也无法利用多核的能力来达到更高的吞吐量，因此也不是一个合理方法，除非程序无法达到 CPU 限制（通常因为网络 I/O 限制）。\n线程较少的程序需要找到一个方法使得一个线程可以处理多个连接。通常需要一个“前端”使用 select/poll, asynchronous I/O, signals or completion ports, 背后使用事件驱动结构。很多“宗教战争”已经打响，同时会持续打下去，为了争论哪种“前端” API 是最佳的。Dan Kegel 的 C10K 文章是一个很好的材料。个人来讲，我认为 select/poll 和 signal 很丑陋，所以我更喜欢使用 AIO 或者 completion port，但是这并不重要。他们都可以工作的很好（可能除了 select），不需要做太多的事情来影响“前端”。\n多线程事件服务最简单的概念模型核心存在一个队列，请求被一个或者多个 listener 线程监听然后放到队列里，然后一个或者多个 worker 线程会从队列获取请求然后处理。概念上这是个好模型，但是人们经常以错误方式实现代码！因为第二种造成上下文切换的情况是在线程间迁移任务。有些人甚至通过要求原始线程来响应请求加剧这个错误--保证每个请求存在两次上下文切换。使用“对称”方法很重要，这种方法可以，给定线程可以从 listener 线程到 worker 线程再到 listener 线程而不需要切换上下文。这是否设计划分线程之间谁为 listener 还是整个线程池轮训作为 listener 并不重要。\n通常，不可能知道在未来某一时刻有多少线程处于活动状态。毕竟，请求可以在任何时候收到任何连接，或者用于维护任务的“后台”线程可以选在在那个时刻唤醒。如果你不知道有多少线程处于活动状态，那么如何限制有多少处于活动状态？根据我的经验，最有效也是最简单的方法：使用计数信号量，每个线程在执行实际工作时都必须持有信号量。如果已经达到线程限制，每个 listen 线程在唤醒后可能发生一次上下文切换，然后阻塞在信号量，但是一旦所有 listen 线程都以这种方式阻塞，它们就不会继续竞争资源，直到某个 worker 线程退出，因此系统影响可以忽略不计。更重要的是，这种方法维护线程--大部分事件都在休眠，因此不计入活动线程--比大多数替代方案优雅。\n一旦请求处理过程被划分为两个阶段（listener 和 worker）通过不同线程处理不同阶段，自然可以将处理过程划分为多余两个阶段。因此，在最简单的形式中，请求处理变成了在一个方向上的依次调用阶段，然后在另一个方向（回复）。但是事情可能会变得复杂。一个阶段可能表示涉及到不同阶段的两个处理路径之间的分叉，或者它可能生成一个回复而不是继续调用后续阶段。因此，每个阶段都需要能够为请求指定“接下来发生什么”。存在三种可能，由阶段函数返回值表示：\n\n请求需要传递到另一个阶段（返回值是ID 或者指针）\n请求已经完成（特定的 request done 返回值）\n请求被阻塞（特定 request blocked 返回值）。等于前面的情况，除了请求不会被释放然后会稍后继续在另一个线程处理。\n\n请注意，在这个模型中，请求排队实在阶段内完成的，而不是在阶段之间。这避免了经常将请求放在后继阶段的队列中，然后立即调用后继阶段并再次将请求出队的常见愚蠢行为；我称之为大量的队列活动，锁定，毫无意义。\n如果这种将复杂任务划分为多个较小的部分看起来很熟悉，因为这个方法很古老。这个方法源于 CAR 在 1978 年提出的 CSP 概念。然而，当 Hoare 创造术语 CSP 时，他的意思是抽象数学意义上的进程，并且 CSP 进程不需要与同名的操作系统实体关联。在我看来，在单个 OS 线程中通过类线程的协程实现 CSP 的常用方法给用户带来了并发的问题但是没有带来可扩展性。\nMatt Welsh 的 SEDA 是现在更明智的发展方向的分阶段执行理念的例子。事实上，SEDA 是“正确服务器架构”的一个很好的例子，值得评论它的一些特征：\n\nSEDA 的批处理倾向于一次通过一个阶段处理多个请求，而我的方法倾向于一次通过多个阶段处理单个请求\n在我看来，SEDA 的一个重大缺陷是每个阶段分配了单独的线程池，只有”后台“在阶段之间重新分配线程以响应负载。结果上面提到的两种上下文切换问题出现了\n在学术研究的背景下，在 Java 中实现 SEDA 可能是有意义的。不过在现实中，我认为这种选择可以说的不幸的。\n\n内存分配\n分配释放内存是非常常见的操作。同时有很多聪明的方法已经被发明出来作为一个通用的内存分配器。但是再多的聪明方案也无法弥补这样的事实，即这种普遍应用的分配器不可避免在某些情况下性能变得很差。因为对于如何避免系统的分配器的问题，我有三个建议。\n建议一：预分配。我们都知道静态分配对于程序功能是糟糕的，但是还有很多形式的预分配是有益的。通常原因归结为这样的事实，一次分配优于多次分配，即使存在浪费。因此如果可以知道使用过程中不会超过 N 条，可以在程序开始申请 N 的有效空间。即使不是这种情况，在开始时预分配请求处理程序可能需要的所有空间可能也比根据需要每次申请空间可取；除了系统分配器可以一次分配多个连续空间的可能性外，也简化了错误恢复代码。如果内存比较紧缺，预分配可能不是一个好的方案，但是通常情况下这是个好选择。\n建议二：对于经常分配释放的对象，使用后备列表。基本思路是将最近释放的对象放回后备列表而不是归还系统，如果很快又再次需要一个对象的空间，就不需要向系统申请内存，直接使用后备列表的内存即可。带来的额外好处就是可以实现从后备列表的转换，而不需要复杂的对象初始化过程。\n通常不希望后备列表不受限制的增长，即使在程序空闲时也不归还给系统。因此，通常需要某种周期性的”清理器“任务来释放非活动对象，但是如果清理器引入了过度的锁机制和竞争，也是不可取的。因此一个好的折中方案是一个后备列表实际上分别锁定旧的和新的列表组成的系统。优先从新列表分配，然后从旧列表分配，然后系统分配是最后选择；对象总是归还到新的列表。清理器线程操作如下：\n\nlock 新和旧列表\n保存旧列表的头\n通过旧列表的头操作将原来的新列表挂上去\nunlock\n释放旧列表的空闲对象\n\n这种系统中的对象只会在一个清理器周期内不被需要才会被清理，但是总少于两个。最重要的是，清理器完成大部分工作时没有持有锁与常规线程竞争。理论上，相同方法可以推广到两阶段以上，但是我没有使用过。\n使用后备列表的一个核心问题是列表指针会提高对象的大小。在我的经验中，大多数我使用后备列表的对象已经包含了列表指针，所有这可能是个无意义的点。即使后备列表需要额外的指针空间，也避免的调用系统分配器，是利大于弊的。\n建议三：尽可能避免使用锁。锁竞争在分配内存上经常是个大消耗，即使使用后备列表。一个解决方案是使用私有的后备列表，这样不存在线程之间的竞争。比如，你可以给每个线程分配一个后备列表。因为处理器 cache 热点问题，每个处理器一个后备列表通常更好，但是只有线程不能被抢占时才有效。如有必要，私有后备列表可以与共享后备列表组合，以创建一个分配开销低的系统。\n（译者注：jemalloc 的 arena）\n锁竞争\n众所周知，高效的锁方案很难设计。Scylla 是简单粗粒度锁，将可以或者应该并发的活动序列化，因此牺牲了性能和可扩展性；Charybdis 是复杂的细粒度锁，锁的空间和锁操作的时间再次削弱了性能。靠近 Scylla 的是死锁或者活锁，靠近 Charybdis 是竞态条件。在两者之间，存在很小的领域是高效正确的锁，或者有吗？因为锁会与程序的逻辑深度绑定，通常不可能设计一个通用的锁适配各种场景。这是人们为什么讨厌锁的原因，并且试图合理化他们的不可扩展的单线程方法。\n几乎每个锁方案都以“一个锁定一切的大锁”开始，并希望性能不会太糟糕。当希望破灭时，总是这样的，大锁呗分解为更小的锁，然后继续祈祷，然后重复这个过程，直到性能够用。通常，每次迭代都会增加20-50%锁的复杂性和锁开销，换取5-10%锁竞争的减少。幸运的是，最终结果是性能获得提升，但是实际上性能反而下降也并不少见。设计者会摸不着头脑，“我把锁做的更细，为什么性能会变差？”\n在我看来，事情变糟了，因为上述方法从根本上被误导了。将“解决方案空间”想像成山脉，高点代表好的方案，低点代表差的方案。问题是“一个大锁”的起点重视被各种山谷，马鞍，较小的山峰和死角与较高的山峰隔开。这是一个经典的全局优化问题，试图从这样的起点达到更高的山峰，只采取小步骤并且不下坡是行不通的。我们需要一种完全不同的方法接近高峰。\n首先是做一个程序和锁的地图，该地图有两个轴：\n\n竖轴表示代码。如果你使用分阶段而不是分支的结构，你应该已经有一个划分，像是每个人都知道的 OSI 模型表示网络协议栈一样。\n横轴代表数据。每个阶段，每个请求都应该分配一个数据集，并且自己的资源与其他集分开。\n\n现在你有一个表格了，每个 cell 表示在特定的处理过程中的特定数据集。重要的是下面的规则：两个请求不应该竞争除非他们在同一个处理过程和同一个数据集。如果你可以管理这些，你已经赢了一半争论。\n一旦你定义了这个表格，每个类型的锁可以被标定，下一个目标是确保生成的点尽可能沿两个轴均匀分布。不幸的是，这部分依赖程序。你需要利用你对程序的了解像钻石切割机一样找到程序阶段和数据集的分界线。有时一开始就很明显，有时很难找到，但是回溯中更明显。将代码划分为多个阶段在程序设计时是比较复杂的，因此不太好给出具体建议，但是可以有一些划分数据集的建议：\n\n如果你的请求与数字，hash 或者事务 id 绑定，你可以很简单按照这些划分数据集\n有时，最好根据哪个数据集有最多的可用资源而不是请求的内在属性来动态将请求分配给数据集。把它想象成现代 CPU 中的多个整数单元，这些人对系统离散数据流的一两个事件有所了解\n通常确保每个阶段的数据集分配不同很有帮助，这样可以保证在一个阶段会竞争的请求在另一个阶段不会发生\n\n如果你已经垂直和水平划分了你的锁空间，并确保锁活动均匀的分布在生成的 cell 中，你可以确定你的锁状态很好。不过还可以更进一步。你还记得小步方法吗，我们之前嘲笑过这种方法？它也有自己的位置，因为现在你在一个很好的点开始而不是糟糕的点。用比喻的术语来说，你可能在最高峰的斜坡，但可能不再山顶。现在是时候收集竞争统计信息，看看你需要做哪些改进，以不同方法拆分阶段和数据集，然后统计信息，持续迭代，直到你满意。如果你做到了，你可以在山顶欣赏风景了。\n其他方面\n上述我已经覆盖了服务设计中四个主要性能问题。当然还存在一些特定服务需要考虑的重要问题。大多数情况下，这些需要考虑你的平台和环境：\n\n你的存储子系统在大/小请求的性能如何？序列换对比随机？read-ahead vs write ahead 呢？\n你使用的网络协议性能如何？你可以通过设置参数或者 flag 获得更好的性能吗？你可以使用 TCP_CORK, MSG_PUSH 或者 Nagle-toggling trick 来避免小包吗？\n你的系统支持扩散读写吗（scatter/gatter I/O(readv/writev)）？使用这个可以提升性能，也可以减轻使用 buffer chain 的痛苦。\n你的 page size 是多少？你的 cache-line size 是多少？值得做一些对齐操作吗？你的系统调用或者上下文切换具体消耗是多少，有相关的其他东西吗？\n你的读写锁会造成饥饿吗？你的事件会造成惊群效应吗？你的睡眠/唤醒会有这样让人讨厌的行为吗（很常见）即当 X 唤醒 Y 时，即使 X 仍有事情要做，上下文切换到 Y 也会立即发生。\n\n我确定我可以顺着这个脉络想到许多问题，你也可以。在特定情况下，可能不需要做什么，但是考虑一下也不失严谨。如果你不知道答案，你可以通过系统文档找到答案。如果没有文档，你可以写一个测试程序或者小的性能测试程序来自己找到答案，写这种程序是一项很有用的技能。如果你写的代码要运行在多平台，其中很多问题你应该抽象到每个平台库相关，然后支持特定功能的平台获得性能提升。\n“知道答案”理论也适用于你的代码，搞清楚代码的高层抽象，然后在不同环境测试耗时。这与传统分析不一样，这是测量而不是实现，底层优化通常是最后的选择。\n","id":"https://wendajiang.github.io/server-design/","title":"【译】server

When an executable is linked with a shared object which has a DT_SONAME field, then when the executable is run the dynamic linker will attempt to load hte shared object specified by the DT_SOMANE field rather than the using the file name given to the linker.\n\nSolution\nSo, I can create the foo.so by\n&gt; gcc -shared -Wl,-soname,libfoo.so foo.cc -o libfoo.so\n\nAnd, the main executable [NEEDED] section will be the libfoo.so name rather than the absolute path.\n\nContinuation\n-Bsymbolic linker option\nAfter learning the soname, I read the Bsymbolic linker option in the tlpi book 41.12[Run-Time Symbol Resolution].\n// prog\nvoid xyz() {\n  printf(\"main-xyz\\n\");\n}\n\nvoid main() {\n  func();\n}\n\n// libfoo.so\nvoid xyz() {\n  printf(\"foo-xyz\\n\");\n}\n\nvoid func() {\n  xyz();\n}\n\nWhat's happened? It print main-xzy. \n\nA definition of a global symbol in the main program overrides a definition in a library.\nIf a global symbol is defined in multiple libraries, then a reference to that symbol is bound to the first definition found by scanning libraries in the left-to-right order in which they were listed on the static link command line.\n\nThese semantics make the transition from static to shared libraries relatively strightforward. But the most significant problem is that these semantics conflict with the model of a shared library as implementing a self-contained subsystem. By default, a shared library can't guarantee that a reference to one of its own glboal symbols will actually be bound to the library's definition of that symbol.\nIn the above scenario, if we wanted to ensure that the invocation of xyz() in the shared library actually called the version of the function defined within the library, then we could use the -Bsymbolic linker option when building the shared library.\nman ld\n\n\n-Bsymbolic \nWhen creating a shared library, bind references to global symbols to the definition within the shared library, if any. Normmally, it is possible for a program linked against a shared library to override the definition within the shared library. This option can also be used with the --export-dynamic option, when creating a position independent executable, to bind references to global symbols to the definition within the executable. This option is only meaningful on ELF paltforms which support shared libraries and position independent executables.\n\nBut, the Bsymbolic maybe cause ugly problem\nOppus, I learn it first, and want to using it for my shared library. And the option conflict with doctest using. \nI deep learn it and find if using singleton, it's expected behavior is if main and shared-library using the one single instance, the -Bsymbolic option destroy it.\nSo the -Bsymbolic using scenoria is the shared-library is self-contained model.\nthe reference https://maskray.me/blog/2021-05-16-elf-interposition-and-bsymbolic explain the reason (pointer equality)\nand https://flameeyes.blog/2012/10/07/symbolism-and-elf-files-or-what-does-bsymbolic-do/\nSupplement Linkers &amp; Loaders\nLinking is the process of combining various pieces of code and data together to form a single executable that can be loader in memory. Linking can be done at compile time, at load time(by loaders) and also at run time (by application programs).\nCompiler, Linker and Loader in Action\ncpp other-command-line-options a.c /tmp/a.i # preprocessor\ncc1 other-command-line-options /tmp/a.i -o /tmp/a.s # compiler proper\nas other-command-line-options /tmp/a.s -o /tmp/a.o # assembler\n# repeat for file b.c\n\nld other-command-line-options /tmp/a.o /tmp/b.o -o a.out\n\nLinkers vs Loaders\n\nProgram Loading. This refers to copying a program image from hard disk to the main memory in order to put the program in ready-to-run state. In some cases, program loading also might invole allocating storage space or mapping virtual addresses to disk pages.\nRelocation. Compilers and assemblers generate the object code for each input module with a starting address of zero. Relocation is the process of assigning load addresses to different parts of the program by merging all sections of the same type into one section. The code and data section also are adjusted so they point to the correct runtime addresses.\nSymbol Resolution. A program is made up of multiple subprograms; reference of one subprogram to another is made through symbols. A linker's job to resolve the reference by noting the symbol's location and patching the caller's object code.\n\nSo a condiderable overlap exists between the functions of linkers and loaders. One way of think of them is: the loader does the program loading; the linker does the symbol resolution; and either of them can do the relocation.\nObject Files\n\nRelocatable object file, which contains binary code and data in a form that can be combined with other relocatable object files at compile time to create an executable object file.\nExecutable object file, which contains binary code and data in a form that can be directly loader into memory and executed.\nShared object file, which is a special type of relocatable object files that can be loaded into memory and linker dynamically, either at load time or at run time.\n\nELF:\nELF Headerstarts with a 4-byte magic string \\177ELF\n.textthe machine code of the compiled program\n.rodataRead-only data, such as the format strings in printf stmt\n.datainitialized global variables\n.bssuninitialized global varitables. BSS stands for block storage start, and this section actually occupies no space in the object file; it is merely a placer holder\n.symtaba symbol table with information about functions and global variables defined and referenced in the program. This table does not contain any entries for local variables; those are maintained on the stack\n.rel.texta list of locations in the .text section that need to be modified when the linker combines this object file with other object files\n.rel.datarelocation information for global variables referenced but not defined in the current module\n.debuga debugging symbol table with entries for local and global variables. This section is present only if the compiler is invoked with -g option\n.linea mapping between line numbers in the original C source program and machine code instructions in the .text section. This information is required by debugger programs\n.strtaba string table for the symbol tables in the .symtab and .debug sections\n\nSymbols and symbol resolution\nEvery relocatable object file has a symbol table and associated symbols. In the context of a linker, the following kins of symbols are present:\n\nGlobal symbols defined by the module and referenced by other modules. All non-static functions and global varitables fall in this category\nGlobal symbols referenced by the input module but defined elsewhere. All functions and variables with extern declaration fall in this category\nLocal symbols defined and referenced exlusively by the input module. All static functions and static variables fall here.\n\nAt compile time, the compilers exports each global symbol as either strong or weak. Functions and initialzed global variables get strong weight, while global uninitialized varaibles are weak.\nLinking with static libraries\nDuring the process of symbol resolution using static libraries, linkers scans the relocatable object files and archives from left to right as input on the command line. During this scan, linker maintains a set of O, relocatable object files that go into the executable; a set U, unresolved symbols; and a set of D, symbols defined in previous input modules. Initially, all three sets are empty.\n\nfor each input argument on the command line, linkers determintes if input is an object files or an archive. If input is relocatable object file, linkers adds it to set O, updates U and D and proceeds to next input file.\nif input is an archive, it scans through the list of member modules that constitute the archive to match any unresolved symbols present in U. If some archive member defines any unresolved symbol that archive member is added to the list O, and U and D are updated per symbols found in the archive member. This process is iterated for all member object files.\nAfter all the input arguments are processed through the above two steps, if U is found be not empty, linker prints an error report and terminates. Otherwise, it merges and relocated the object files in O to build the ouput executable file.\n\nThis also explains why static libraries are placed at the end of the linker command. Special care must be taken in cases of cyclic dependencies libraries. Input libraries must be ordered so each symbol is referenced by a member of an archive and at least one definition of a symbol is followed by a reference to it on the command line. Also, if an unresolved symbol is defined in more than one static library moduels, the definition is picked from the first library found in the command line.\nRelocation\nOnce the linker has resolved all the symbols, each symbol reference has exactly one definition. At this point, linker starts the process of relocation, which involves the following two steps:\n\nRelocaing sections and symbol definitions. Linker merges all the sections of the same type into a new single section. The linker then assigns runtime memory addresses to new aggregate sections, to each section defined by the input module and also to each symbol. After the completion of this step, every instruction and global variable in the program has a unique loadtime address\nRelocating symbolo reference within sections. In this step, linker modifies every symbol reference in the code and data sections so they point to the correct loadtime addresses.\n\nWhenever assembler encounters an unresolved symbol, it generates a relocation entry for that object and places it in the .relo.text/.relo.data sections. A relocation entry contains information about how to resolve the reference. A typical ELF relocation entry contains the following members:\n\nOffset, a section offset of the reference that needs to be relocated. For a relocatable file, this value is the byte offset from the beginning of the section to the storage unit affected by relocation.\nSymbol, a symbol the modified reference should point to. It is the symbol table index with respect to which the relocation must be made.\nType, the relocation type, normally R_386_PC32, that signifies PC-relative addressing. R_386_32 signifies absolute addressing.\n\nThe linker iterates over all the relocation entries present in the relocatable object modules and relocates the unresolved symbols depending on the type. For R_386_PC32, the relocating address is calculated as S + A - P; for R_386_32 type, the address is calculated as S + A. In these calculations, S denotes the value of the symbol from the relocation entry, P denotes the section offset or address of the storage unit being relocated (computed using the value of offset from relocation entry) and A is the address needed to compute the value of the relocatable field.\nDynamic linking: Shared libraries\nA shared library is an object module that can be loaded at run time at an arbitrary memory address, and it can be linked to by a program in memory.\n-fPIC option tells the compiler to generate position independent code (PIC)\ngcc -shared -fPIC -o libfoo.so a.o b.o\ngcc bar.o ./libfoo.so\n\nThe executable simply contains some relocation and symbol table information that allow references to code and data in libfoo.so to be resolved at run time. Thus, a.out here is a partially executable file that still has its dependency in libfoo.so. The executable also contains a .interp section that contains the name of the dynamic linker, which itself is a shared object on Linux systems (ld-linux.so). So, when the executable is loaded into memory, the loader passes control to the dynamic linker. The dynamic linker contains some start-up code that maps the shared libraries to the program's address space. It then does the following:\n\nrelocates the text and data of libfoo.so into memory segment; and\nrelocateds any references in a.out to symbols defined by libfoo.so\n\nFinaly, the dynamic linker passes control to the application. From this point on, location of shared object is fixed in the memory.\nLoading shared libraries from applications\ndlopen / dlsym / dlclose\nTools for manipulating object files\n\nar: creates static libraries\nobjdump: this is the most important binary tool; it can be used to display all the information in an object binary file\nstrings: list all the printable strings in binary file\nnm: lists the symbols defined in the symbol table of an object file\nldd: lists the shared libraries on which the object binary is dependent\nstrip: deletes the symbol table information\n\nexecutable shared-library\nThis blog describe in detail.\nstackoverflow introduct a more realistic example pcap.\nreference\n\nhttps://tldp.org/HOWTO/Program-Library-HOWTO/shared-libraries.html\nnm -g main | rg rpath\nreadelf -p man | rg -i needed\nobjdump -p main | rg -i needed\n\n\nthe rules order of runtime search dynamic library is tlpi book section 41.11\nAnother useful environment variable in the GNU C loader is LD_DEBUG.

\nFred&amp; x() {\n  static Fred* ans = new Fred();\n  return *ans;\n}\n\nBarney::Barney() {\n  // ..\n  x().do_something();\n}\n\n这就意味着 leak 了一个 Fred 对象，如果 Fred 对象析构函数必须被调用，可以使用 v2 版本的 Construct On First Use Idiom\n// 为什么不使用一个 local scope static object 来代替指针\nFred&amp; x() {\n  static Fred ans;\n  return ans;\n}\n\n实际呢这里引入了另一个微妙我遇到的问题。让我们来回顾一下，这些技术是为了达到什么目的？\n\n(a)第一次使用 static 对象肯定是已经构造完成的。\n(b)直到最后一次使用才析构\n\n显然如果在第一次使用前没有构造，或者最后一次使用前已经析构都是问题所在。意味着我们要考虑头和尾。现在 v2 版本的方案已经解决了使用前一定构造的问题，并且没有造成对象的 leak【实际呢，如果是一个会退出的程序，这种泄漏也可以接受，毕竟在进程退出后，系统会回收内存，并没有很大影响】\n但是，这种方案存在问题，就是不能确保多个 static 对象的析构顺序。\n我遇到的问题\n// logger.h\nclass GlobalLogger;\n\nGlobalLogger&amp; logger() {\n  static GlobalLogger&amp; logger;\n  return logger;\n}\n\n// file_monitor.h\nclass FileMonitor;\n/* FileMonitor is one data member of a global static object*/\nFileMonitor::~FileMonitor() {\n  // do something\n  logger().log(\"something\");\n}\n\n\n大部分时间运行没有问题，但是并没有保证在 FileMonitor 析构中使用 GlobalLogger 是有效的。所以在某些情况，会 crash。\n那么如何解决这个问题？ioscpp 也提出了解决方案 Nifty Counter Idiom。\n原理就是在头文件中定义一个辅助 static object 的计数 class，这样每个 include 头文件的编译单元就会创建一个内部的计数对象，在计数对象构造函数中积累计数，析构函数中消除计数，同时控制一个 extern global 要使用的 static object 对象的创建与销毁，达到\n\n(a)第一个次使用 static 对象肯定是已经构造完成的。\n(b)直到最后一次使用才析构\n\n这个目的，即同时控制构造和析构。\nnifty counter idiom 例子：\n// Stream.h\n#ifndef STREAM_H\n#define STREAM_H\n\nstruct Stream {\n  Stream ();\n  ~Stream ();\n};\nextern Stream&amp; stream; // global stream object\n\nstatic struct StreamInitializer {\n  StreamInitializer ();\n  ~StreamInitializer ();\n} streamInitializer; // static initializer for every translation unit\n\n#endif // STREAM_H\n\n// Stream.cpp\n#include \"Stream.h\"\n\n#include &lt;new&gt;         // placement new\n#include &lt;type_traits&gt; // aligned_storage\n\nstatic int nifty_counter; // zero initialized at load time\nstatic typename std::aligned_storage&lt;sizeof (Stream), alignof (Stream)&gt;::type\n  stream_buf; // memory for the stream object\nStream&amp; stream = reinterpret_cast&lt;Stream&amp;&gt; (stream_buf);\n\nStream::Stream ()\n{\n  // initialize things\n}\nStream::~Stream ()\n{\n  // clean-up\n} \n\nStreamInitializer::StreamInitializer ()\n{\n  if (nifty_counter++ == 0) new (&amp;stream) Stream (); // placement new\n}\nStreamInitializer::~StreamInitializer ()\n{\n  if (--nifty_counter == 0) (&amp;stream)-&gt;~Stream ();\n}\n\n其中不同与一般方式的实现是：定义了一个 static(local to the translation unit) buffer，这个 buffer 足够存放一个 Stream。Stream 对象的引用定义在头文件中，然后设置成指向 buffer 的指针。这样实现能更好的控制 Stream 对象的构造和析构的调用。上面的例子中，构造函数在 StreamInitializer 第一次调用前被调用，然后使用 placement new 设置指针，析构函数在最后一个 StreamInitializer 使用后被调用。\n如果是在 Stream.cpp 中定义一个 Stream 变量，会在 StreamInitializer 之后定义（这个在头文件中定义）。那么 StreamInitializer 构造函数就会在 Stream 构造函数之前运行，更糟糕的是 Initializer 的析构函数会在 Stream 析构之后运行。buffer 方案避免了这个问题。\n由此，解决了 static object 对象构造和析构有依赖关系的问题。\nSingleton ？\n在这里发现 v2 版本的 \"Construct On First Use Idiom\" 基本就是 Meyer's Singleton 的写法，这种写法在 C++11 之后是一个线程安全（有了内存模型和顺序）的延迟单例写法。这里回顾一下单例模式在 C++ 中的各种实现\n单线程写法\ntemplate&lt;typename T&gt;\nclass Singleton {\n  public:\n  static T&amp;

Cloud Dataflow）工作的我来说，很乐于看到这种源源不断的流计算的思潮。对于如何保证人们理解并应用流式系统，特别是在现存的批处理和流处理系统存在一定的语义鸿沟的情况下，我很感兴趣。因而接下来的内容将分为两个部分：\n\nStreaming 101：第一篇文章会介绍基本的背景情况以及一些术语，然后再深入到时域，以及对批处理和流处理的一般方法做高度的概括。\nDataflow 模型：第二篇文章主要介绍 Cloud Dataflow 所使用的批流统一的模型，并以一个例子应用不同的场景来辅助说明。最后对现有的批处理和流处理系统做一个简要的语义上的比较。\n\n闲话少说，下面进入主题。\n背景\n开始前，我会介绍一些重要的背景信息， 以帮助构建接下来我将要讨论的主题框架。下面我会分为三个部分：\n\n术语：越是讨论复杂的话题，就越是需要精准的定义。对于当下有各种解释的术语，我会具体说明在这里的含义。\n功能：我会指出流式系统的缺点，同时提出构建数据处理系统的框架思想，以满足消费者日益增长的需求。\n时域：我会介绍数据处理中两种主要的时域、它们的相关性，并指出二者带来的困难。\n\n术语： 流（streaming）是什么？\n在接下来的内容之前，首先我们要解决的是：流到底是什么？“流”可以表示各种不同的意思，这可能导致我们误解流到底是什么以及流式系统究竟能做什么。鉴于此，我会尽可能地准确定义这些术语。\n当前问题的关键在于许多事情应该由它们是什么（例如无限数据处理、近似结果等）来定义，然而事实上经常由它们在历史上是如何（例如通过流计算引擎）实现的来进行介绍。术语上的这种不准确导致了流的真正含义变得模糊，有时候甚至把流式系统的功能局限于流的特性，如近似和推测结果。由于精心设计的流式系统也能够和批处理系统一样产生正确、一致、可重复的结果。所以这里我倾向给“流”下一个更加精确的定义：一种针对无限数据集而设计的数据处理引擎。仅此而已。（为了防止有失偏颇，有必要说明一下这个定义同时包括了真正的流以及微批的实现方式。）\n作为“流”的常见场景，下面是我常听到的，每个都被精确定义，我也建议我们的社区应该采用：\n\n无限数据：一种不断增长的，本质上无限的数据集。这些通常被称为“流数据”（streaming data）。然而，当应用于数据集时，流或批的术语是有问题的，因为这意味着使用特定的执行引擎来处理这些数据集。两种类型的数据集之间的关键区别在于现实中它们的有限性，因此最好用这种能够区分它们特征的术语。因此，我倾向于将无限的“流”数据集称为无限数据，有限的“批”数据集叫做有限数据。\n无限数据处理：一种持续的数据处理模式，适用于上述的无限数据。虽然我个人很想使用“流”这个术语来描述数据处理的类型，但是这种情况下的使用再次暗示使用了流计算引擎，这根本就是误导；而自从设计了批处理系统以来，我们就一直重复运行批处理引擎来处理无限数据（相反地，精心设计的流式系统能够比批处理系统更会处理有限数据）。因此，为了清楚定义，我将简单地称之为无限数据处理。\n低延迟、近似、推测结果：结果的类型往往和流计算引擎相关。事实上，批处理系统从一开始就没有被设计为低延迟或者推测结果，这是历史事实，仅此而已。当然，如果有必要的话批处理引擎完全有能力产生近似结果。因此，对于上述的术语，应该按照它们本来的样子（低延迟、近似、推测结果）来描述，这胜过说它们历史上如何表现的（通过流计算引擎）。\n\n从现在开始，任何时候使用术语“流”，意思都是设计用于无限数据集的执行引擎，仅此而已。当我谈到上述任何其他术语时，我会直接说无限数据，无限数据处理或低延迟、近似、推测结果。这些是我们在 Cloud Dataflow 中采用的术语，同时我鼓励其他人也如此使用。\n被过分夸大的流处理的局限\n接下来，谈一谈流式处理系统能做什么和不能做什么，重点在能做什么；其中我最想做的事情就是讨论一个精心设计的流处理究竟可以做到什么。流式系统长期以来一直被放在提供低延迟，不准确/推测结果的场景里，通常结合批处理系统来提供最终正确的结果，即 Lambda 架构。\n对于不熟悉 Lambda 架构的你来说，只需要知道它的基本思想就是在批处理系统旁边运行一个流处理系统，并且执行基本相同的计算。流式处理系统提供低延迟、不准确的结果（由于使用近似算法，或者因为流系统本身不提供准确性的保证），所以每过一段时间，批处理系统便持续滚动处理并计算出正确的结果。该思想最初是由 Twitter 的 Nathan Marz（Apache Storm 的创始人）提出的，最终是相当成功的因为在当时这是个很棒的想法；流计算引擎在正确性方面让人失望，而批处理天生笨拙，所以 Lambda 为您提供了一种方法让您鱼和熊掌兼得。然而维护 Lambda 系统是一件麻烦：需要构建和维护两个版本的管道，并且要将两者的结果合并。\n和一些常年从事于强一致性流计算引擎的人一样，我对 Lambda 架构的整个概念感到有点讨厌。不出所料，当 Jay Kreps 的文章 Lambda 架构质疑 一出，我变成了他的铁粉。这是反对双模式执行的必要性的首次有力陈述。Kreps 使用 Kafka 这样的可重放系统作为流计算架构的内部连接，从而解决了可重复的问题，甚至进一步提出了 Kappa 架构，这基本意味着可以使用一个精心设计的系统来运行单一的管道。我不确定这个概念需要个名字，但是我完全支持这个概念。\n老实说，我会走得更远。我会讨论一个精心设计的流式系统事实上提供了一个批处理功能之上的严格超集。感谢 Flink 的开发者将这一思想牢记于心，并构建了一个一直完全流式的系统，甚至包含批的模式。\n所有这一切的必然结果是广泛成熟的流式系统，加上用于无限数据处理的健壮框架，最终 Lambda 架构将回到它所属的大数据的历史洪荒中去。我相信这将成为现实。因为在这场比赛中打败批处理，你今需要两个概念：\n\n正确性——这让你与批处理平起平坐\n首先，正确性归结为一致性存储。流式系统需要伴随时间存在的检查点来持久化状态信息（有些内容 Kreps 在他的 为什么本地状态是是流处理的基本原语 有提及），而且必须设计得足够好，能够在机器出现故障时保持一致性。当 Spark Streaming 几年前首次出现在公开的大数据场景下时，那简直是幽暗的流计算世界里一致性的灯塔。庆幸的是自那以后情况有所好转，但是仍然有不少流式系统运行在没有强一致性的情况下；我真的不敢相信至多一次处理仍然是个问题，但事实就是。\n重申一下，因为这点很重要：仅仅一次的处理要求很强的一致性，这对于正确性是必要条件，而且这对于希望达到甚至超过批处理系统的能力的任何系统而言都是必需的。除非你真的不在乎结果，否则我恳求你不要使用那些不能提供强一致性状态的流式系统。批处理系统不需要你事先验证它们是否能够产生正确的结果；因而不要把时间浪费在那些不能实现相同目标的流式系统上。\n如果想了解更多关于流式系统中如何实现强一致性，可以参考 MillWheel 和 Spark Streaming 论文。两篇论文花了大量时间讨论一致性。由于这些论文对此给出了高质量的介绍，本文将不会赘述。\n关于时间的推理工具——这让你超越批处理\n对于乱序无限数据流，数据产生的时间和数据真正被处理的时间之间的的偏差很大，用于推理时间的工具至关重要。越来越多的现代数据集体现了这个特点，现有的批处理系统（以及大多数流处理系统）缺乏必要的工具来应对这个问题。接下来以及下一篇文章，我们都将聚焦于此。\n首先，我们将对时域概念有一个基本的了解，之后我们将更深入了解我所说的无限的、乱序的、不同的事件时间倾斜是什么意思。剩下的时间我们再了解使用批处理和流式系统处理有限和无限的数据的常用方法。\n\n事件时间 vs. 处理时间\n要阐述无限数据的处理方式，需要清楚地了解时间所涉及的领域。在任何数据处理系统中，通常有两种时间值得关注：\n\n事件时间，即事件发生的真实时间\n处理时间，即事件被系统观察到的时间\n\n并不是所有情况下都需要关心事件的时间（如果你的不需要，万岁啊——你的生活因此更加简单），但大多数情况下需要，例如根据时间刻画用户行为，大多数计费应用程序、不同类型的异常检测。\n在一个理想的世界中，事件在发生时即被处理，因而事件时间和处理时间总是相等的。然而，现实并非如此，事件时间和处理时间之间总会存在偏差，而且通常严重受到数据底层输入源，执行引擎甚至硬件的影响。可能影响的因素包括：\n\n共享资源限制，如网络拥塞，网络分区或在非专用环境中共享CPU。\n软件因素，如分布式系统的复杂逻辑、资源竞争等。\n数据本身的特性，包括 key 的分布、吞吐的差异、乱序（例如将飞机上的所有乘客的手机都从飞行模式中退出来）。\n\n因此，如果要将实际系统中事件时间和处理时间的进度关系画出来的话，您得到的应该是类似于图1中红线的结果。\n\n斜率为1的黑色虚线表示理想状态下，处理时间和事件时间一致；红线表示现实情况。在这个例子中，系统在处理时间的前段落后一点，在中间偏向理想状态，然后再次落后直到最后。黑色虚线与红线之间的水平距离是处理时间和事件时间之间的偏差。这种偏差本质上就是处理管道所带来的延迟。\n由于事件时间和处理时间之间的关系不是静态的，如果关注数据的事件时间，那么就不能仅仅基于在你的数据管道中所观察到的时间来分析数据。不幸的是，现有的大多数系统都是为处理时间而设计的。为了处理无限数据集的无穷的特性，这些系统通常对于传入的数据提供了窗口概念。下面将深入讨论窗口，但它本质上其实就是将无限数据集沿着时间的边界切分成有限数据集。\n如果您关注正确性并且希望基于事件时间分析数据，那么就不能像那些现有的系统一样来使用处理时间（即处理时间窗口）来定确定那些边界；由于处理时间和事件时间不具备一致的相关性，使用处理时间会导致一些数据划分到错误的窗口中（由于分布式系统的固有滞后，各种类型输入源的在线/离线特性等等），导致不正确的结果。我会在下面的例子以及接下来一篇文章中详细介绍这个问题。\n不幸的是，按照事件时间进行窗口操作也不是那么乐观。对于事件时间窗口来说，基于无限的数据，乱序和可变的时间延迟会引入一致性的问题：处理时间和事件时间之间的关系是不可预测的，那么给定一个事件时间 X，你如何确定所有数据都到达了？对于多数真实的数据源，你恐怕无法简简单单就做到。目前使用的绝大多数数据处理系统都依赖于一些完整性的概念，这使得它们不太容易处理无限的数据集。\n所以我建议与其试图将无限数据变成最终一致的有限批次数据，还不如设计一些工具让我们生活在这种不确定的世界中，从而应对这些复杂的数据集。新数据将要到达，旧数据可能会被撤回或更新，我们构建的任何系统都应该能够应对这些事实，这里使用完整性的概念是方便阐述，而不是必要的术语。\n在深入研究我们是如何使用 Cloud Dataflow 中用到的 Dataflow 模型来构建这样一个系统之前，让我们先学习一些背景知识：一般的数据处理模式。\n数据处理模式\n至此，我们已经掌握了足够的背景知识，现在开始研究有限及无限数据处理中常见的几种处理模式。我们针对这两种计算引擎，研究它们的处理类型以及相关之处（这里指的是批处理和流式处理，我把微批处理和流处理放在了一起，因为这二者在这级别上的差异并不是很大）。\n有限数据\n处理有限数据是非常简单的，我们都很熟悉，例如Hadoop，在最开始都是为了处理有限数据集而出现的。在下图中，从左边开始，一个混乱无序的数据集，经过数据处理引擎（通常是批处理引擎，精心设计的流处理引擎也可以），如 MapReduce，最后在右侧产生一个更具价值的新的结构化数据集：\n\n尽管作为这个方案的一部分，您实际上可以计算出无数种可能性，但整个模型是非常简单的。而更有意思的的是处理无限数据集。现在来看看处理无限数据的几种方式，从传统批处理引擎使用的方法开始，最后看看设计用于无限数据的系统使用的方法，诸如大多数流处理或微批引擎。\n无限数据——批处理\n批处理引擎虽然不是为无限数据集处理而设计，但是自批处理系统诞生以来都在用于处理无限数据集。而且很容想到，这种处理方式就是将无限数据集分解成适合于批处理的有限数据集。\n固定窗口\n处理无限数据集的最常见方法就是将输入数据分配到固定大小的窗口中，将这些窗口中作为单独、有限的数据集进行处理，然后不断运行。例如像日志这种输入源，将事件写入文件目录，名称对应所属的窗口，只要基于时间执行 shuffle，让数据分配到合适的事件时间窗口中即可。\n实际上，大多数系统仍然有一个完整性的问题需要处理：如果一些事件由于网络分区而延迟该怎么办？如果需要从全球各地收集事件，必须在处理之前传输到一个公共的位置？如果事件来自移动设备又该怎么办？这意味着必须要有某种方式来解决此类问题（例如延迟处理直到确定已收集所有事件，或者在数据迟到时，为指定窗口重新处理整个批次）。\n\n会话\n当您面对更加复杂的窗口策略（如会话）时，还希望使用批处理引擎来处理无限数据，这样几乎是徒劳的。会话窗口通常被定义为一个活动周期，超过一定时间不再活动就认为会话窗口中止。当使用批处理引擎计算会话窗口时，通常会遇到会话的数据拆分在2个或多个批次中的情况，如下图中的红色标记所示。可以通过增加每批次数据量的大小来减少拆分数量，但是代价是增加了延迟。另一个选择是增加额外的逻辑，从之前的运行中合并会话，但带来了更高的复杂度。\n\n不管怎样，使用传统的批处理引擎来计算会话都不够理想。更好的方式是以流的方式来构建会话，接下来我们一起看看吧。\n无限数据——流式处理\n与大多数基于批的无限数据处理方法的特殊性相反，流式系统是专为无限数据构建的。如前所述，对于现实世界的很多分布式输入数据源，不仅要处理无限的数据，而且要处理这样的数据：\n\n高度无序的事件时间，这意味着如果想在事件发生的上下文来分析数据，则需要在Pipeline中进行基于时间的 shuffle。\n多样的事件时间差，这意味着你不能仅仅假设大部分数据的事件时间 X 的与时间 Y 的差距在一个常数 ε 内。\n\n处理具备这些特征的数据，一般有几种方法，我通常将它们分为以下四类：\n\n时间无关\n近似解\n基于处理时间的窗口\n基于事件时间的窗口\n\n下面我们来依次分析。\n时间无关\n时间无关的处理一般用于与时间无关的场景，即所有相关逻辑都是数据驱动的。由于这种情况下持续的数据输入最为重要，流处理引擎除了满足数据传输的特性外，不需要其他的。因此，基本上所有流处理系统都支持时间无关的使用场景（系统到系统的一致性保证，对关心正确性的人有用）。批处理系统非常适用于时间无关的无限数据集处理，它会通过简单地将无限数据切分成任意的有限数据集然后单独地处理它们。我们将在本节中看几个具体的例子，由于时间无关的处理简单直观，所以并不会花很多时间在上面。\n过滤\n一种最基本的时间无关的处理就是过滤。假设正在处理 Web 流量日志，并且要过滤掉非特定域名的所有流量。每条记录到达时，检查是否来自某个来源，如果不是则丢弃。由于这种处理只针对单个元素，而事实上数据源是无限的、乱序的以及多样的事件时间差这几个因素是无关紧要的。\n\n内连接\n另一个时间无关的例子是内连接（或者叫哈希连接）。当 join 两个无限数据源时，如果只关心连接的结果，则不需要关注时间。从一个数据源接收1个值，你可以直接缓存为持久化状态；一旦来自另一个源的第2个值到达时，仅需要发出连接上的记录。（在实际中，有一些记录可能没有合适的关联数据进行连接，此时可能需要基于时间进行清理掉旧数据，但是对于很少或没有未完成连接的情况，这问题不大。）\n\n至于外连接则存在我们之前讨论过的数据完整性问题：一方数据到了，你怎么知道另一方数据是否会到达？ 在实际中，很难确定，所以必须使用超时的概念，这也因此要引入时间元素。而时间元素在本质上就是一种窗口形式，稍后会更详细地介绍。\n近似算法\n\n第二类方法是近似算法，例如近似Top-N、流的K均值等。它们采用无限输入数据源，并提供输出数据。近似算法的优点在于它们的开销比较小，专为无限数据集而设计。缺点是算法本身往往是复杂的（这使得难以引出新的算法），并且这种近似的特性限制了它的用武之地。\n值得注意的是：这些算法通常在其设计中考虑了时间因素（例如某种内置的衰减）。而且一般采用到达时处理元素的策略，所以通常是基于处理时间的。这一点对于可以证明近似算法的误差范围特别重要。如果这些误差范围在数据顺序到达的情况下可以证明，那么在应对不同事件时间的差距时它们什么也不是，这些算法也将无用。\n近似算法是一个很有趣的主题，由于它们本质上是与时间无关的处理，因此它们非常简单易用，此处便不再赘述。\n窗口\n无限数据剩下的两种处理，都是基于窗口的变体。 在深入不同窗口类型的差异之前，需要明确一下窗口的含义。 窗口其实就是对数据源（不论是无限还是有限的）在时间上进行切分，得到有限的数据块。 下图显示了三种不同的窗口模式：\n\n\n固定窗口：固定窗口将时间分割成具有固定大小时间段。通常（如图8所示），固定窗口均匀的分隔整个数据集，这是对齐窗口的示例。在某些情况下，希望对于数据的不同子集（如根据键来）进行相移，以随着时间的推移更均匀地扩展窗口完成负载，而不是随着数据变化，否则那就是非对齐窗口了。\n滑动窗口：滑动窗口由固定长度和时间周期定义。如果时间周期小于长度，则窗口重叠。如果周期等于长度，则等同于固定窗口。如果周期大于长度，有一些数据就无法分配到窗口中。与固定窗口一样，滑动窗口通常对齐，在某些使用情况下可能会为优化性能而不对齐。注意，图 8 中的滑动窗口被绘制出滑动感；实际上，所有五个窗口将应用于整个数据集。\n会话窗口：会话是一种动态窗口，会话由事件序列组成，会话之间由于大于某个超时时间而产生间隔。会话通常用于分析一段时间内的用户行为，通过将一系列时间相关的事件（例如，一次观看的视频序列）分组在一起。会话很有意思的，因为长度不能被事先定义而取决于实际数据。它是非对齐窗口的典型示例，因为会话在不同的数据子集（例如不同的用户）上几乎不相同。\n\n其中的处理时间和事件时间时我们主要关注的。窗口在两种时间类型中都是有意义的，接下来我们看看二者的区别。 因为处理时间在现有系统中应用最广，那么首先从处理时间开始。\n基于处理时间的窗口\n\n当基于处理时间划分窗口时，系统将进入的数据缓冲到窗口中，一直到窗口末尾的时间。 例如，在5分钟固定窗口的情况下，系统将缓冲数据，处理时间为5分钟，之后将其在5分钟内收到所有数据视为1个窗口，并将其发送到下游进行处理。\n处理时间有以下几个优点：\n\n简单。不需要根据时间 shuffle 数据，因而实现起来容易。只需在数据到达时缓冲数据，并在窗口关闭时向下游发送。\n容易判断完整性。由于系统很清楚地知道窗口的数据，所以很容易判断窗口是否已经完成。这意味着使用处理时间可以不再需要处理“迟到的”数据。\n如果你想根据收到的数据推测信息，那么处理时间很合适。许多监控方案属于这一类。 举例来说，跟踪每秒发送到全球规模Web服务的请求数， 来检测中断，计算这些请求的速率是处理时间窗口的完美用法。\n\n此外，处理时间窗口有一个很大的缺点：如果数据中带有事件时间，而处理时间窗口需要反映出这些事件真实发生的时间的话，那么则要求这些事件以事件时间的顺序到达。可惜的是，事件时间有序的数据在大多数现实的分布式场景中并不常见。\n考虑一个简单的案例，有一个移动 App 收集使用统计信息以供后续处理。如果给定的移动设备离线（短时间内连接失败，调为飞行模式等），则在该设备上线之前不会上传数据。这意味着数据可能会出现事件时间偏差几分钟、几个小时、几天、几周甚至更长时间。这时使用处理时间窗口的话是无法从这样的数据集中推断出设备离线或者其他有用的信息的。\n再举一个例子，当整个系统正常时，一些分布式输入源在一切正常运转时似乎能够提供事件时间有序（或接近有序）的数据。这个时候的事件时间偏差比较小，但并不意味着会始终这样。在全球性的场景中，Web 服务跨越了多个大陆，收集数据受限于跨洋线路的带宽，进一步降低了带宽和/或提高了延迟，那么输入数据的一部分可能突然以比以前更大的偏差到达系统。如果通过处理时间窗口处理数据，则窗口不再代表其中实际发生的数据；相反，窗口代表事件到达系统的时间窗口，而这会导致旧数据和当前数据混在一起。\n在这两种情况下，要想事件按照事件时间顺序的处理，需要的是事件时间窗口。\n基于事件时间的窗口\n在你需要以事件真实发生的时间来观察数据时，需要使用事件时间窗口。这是窗口的黄金法则。可惜的是，当今的大多数系统缺乏对于事件事件的本地支持（虽然有些具有很好的一致性模型的系统，比如 Hadoop 或者 Spark Streaming，也可以构建这样的一个窗口的系统）。\n下图显示了将无限数据源中的数据，按照1小时长度的固定窗口进行切分的示例：\n\n该图中的白实线标出了两个感兴趣的数据。 从图中可以看出，这两类数据都到达处理时间窗口，但是与它们所属的事件时间窗口不匹配。 因此，想按照事件时间进行处理，如果使用处理时间窗口，则计算结果将不正确。显然，使用事件时间窗口才能达到事件时间上的正确性。\n另外在处理无限数据的时候，使用事件时间窗口，可以创建动态大小的窗口。例如会话窗口，此种情况下，使用固定窗口会将紧密相关联数据分隔到不同的窗口（之前在“无限数据——批处理”部分的会话窗口示例中说明过）：\n\n当然，强大的语义来之不易，事件时间窗口也不例外。事件时间窗口由于通常比窗口本身的实际长度（处理时间）更长，因而具有以下两个缺点：\n\n缓存：由于窗口的生命周期变长，需要缓存更多的数据。持久化存储通常是最廉价缓存方式（其他主要是CPU，网络带宽和RAM）。因此，当使用具有强一致持久化状态和良好的内存缓存的数据处理系统时，这一般不是个大问题。此外，一些聚合运算不需要缓存整个输入集（例如求和或平均值），而是只需要增量计算，这在持久化状态中占用很小。\n完整性：由于难以知道一个窗口是否所有的数据都到齐了，那么我们怎么知道在哪个时刻计算结果呢？事实上，不必如此。但是对于许多类型的输入源，系统可以通过像 MillWheel 的 Watermark（下篇文章将详细讨论）来给出对于窗口的数据到齐的准确的启发式估计。但是在必须要保证绝对正确的情况下（例如计费），唯一的选择是为管道提供一种方式来表示何时计算结果，以及这些结果如何随着时间的推移而更正。处理窗口的完整性是一个有趣的话题，但最好结合具体的例子来探讨，下一章我们再见。\n\n总结\n哇喔，信息量好大啊。对于看到此处的你值得表扬！到这里我们已经完成了我想要介绍的一半的内容，所以回头看看，回顾一下之前介绍过的内容，在深入到第二部分之前，我们稍微放慢脚步。第一部分是无聊的阐述，第二部分才是真正有趣的地方。\n回顾\n总结下，我讲过：\n\n澄清了术语，特别是将”流”（streaming）的定义限定为仅适用于执行引擎，而使用更加描述到位的术语如无限数据和近似/推测结果这样不归属于流的范畴的概念。\n评估了精心设计的批处理和流式系统的相对功能，假定流式处理事实上是批处理的严格超集，而像 Lambda

Dataflow 模型中的数据处理概念分解为四块：what、where、when、how。\n详细介绍在多个场景下处理简单、具体的数据集实例，重点介绍 Dataflow 模型所支持的多个用例，以及涉及到的具体 API。这些例子将有助于理解本文介绍的事件时间和处理时间的概念，另外将探索一些新概念，如水位线。\n对于现有的数据处理系统，比较这两篇文章中涉及到的一些重要特征，从而更容易从中作出选择，并改善其中的不足，我的终极目标是在整个大数据社区对于数据处理系统，尤其是流式系统的改善。\n\n","id":"https://wendajiang.github.io/streaming101/","title":"streaming101"},"https://wendajiang.github.io/streaming102/":{"body":"原文：https://www.oreilly.com/radar/the-world-beyond-batch-streaming-102/\n闲话少说，下面进入主题。先总结下，上次的内容主要分三块：\n\n术语，定义了我所谓的“流”（streaming）到底是什么意思。\n批与流，比较了这两种类型系统的理论功能，并提出了两个可以让流式系统超越批处理系统的概念：正确性和时间推理工具。\n数据处理模式，介绍了批处理和流式系统用于处理有限及无限数据的基本方法。\n\n本文中，将继续关注上次说的数据处理模式，而且通过具体实例来介绍细节。下面将本文主要分为两个部分：\n\n**Streaming 101 回顾：**简单回顾之前介绍的一些概念，并用一个实例来加以说明。\nStreaming 102：作为上篇的配套教程，详细介绍了处理无限数据的其他概念，并继续用具体案例来解释。\n\n通过本文，您将掌握一个健壮的无序数据处理所需的核心原则和概念，同时拥有让您超越批处理的时间推理工具。\n为了让您对于实现方式有个直观的认识，我将会使用 Dataflow SDK 的代码片段（即 Google Cloud Dataflow 的 API），并辅以动画让这些概念可视化。我使用的是 Dataflow SDK 而不是人们所熟悉的 Spark Streaming 或者 Storm 等，原因在于还没有一个别的系统更加适合用于表达我想介绍的例子。不过好消息是有些项目正在朝着这个方向努力。更好的消息是，我们（谷歌）如今已经（联合 data Artisans、Cloudera、Talend 等公司）向 Apache 软件基金会提交了一份创建 Apache Dataflow 孵化项目的议案。希望围绕 Dataflow 模型 提供的健壮的无序数据处理语义来构建一个开放的社区及生态。这让我很期待 2016 年。擦，跑题了。\n不过这篇文章缺少了我上次承诺的比较部分。对不起，我低估了我所要将的内容究竟有多少，究竟要花多少时间。但是呢，我又不知道该把所拖延的和该拓展的内容放在哪里。如果能安慰您的话呢，其实我在2015年的新加坡的 Strata + Hadoop World 做了一个演讲，题目是“大规模数据处理的演进”（2016年会在伦敦的 Strata + Hadoop World 做一个更新版本的演讲），其中涵盖了一些我之前想做的承诺的部分；这里有当时的 PPT。虽然不是完全一样，但是值得一读。\n好，现在我们开始看“流”。\n回顾与路线图\n在Streaming 101中，首先澄清了一些术语,介绍了有限数据 VS 无限数据。有限数据源具有有限的大小，通常被称为“批处理”数据。无限数据源具有无限大小，通常被称为“流”数据。在后边将会尽量避免使用批处理和流式来修饰数据源，因为这些名称有其局限性并容易让人误解。\n然后，解释了批处理和流式处理引擎之间的区别：批处理引擎是设计优先考虑有限数据（现在批处理引擎也提供了micro-batch的方式处理流式数据），而流式处理引擎设计用于处理无限数据。我只会在描述执行引擎时使用批处理和流式处理。\n定义完术语之后，介绍了与处理无限数据有关的两个重要的基本概念。首先阐述事件时间（事件发生的时间）和处理时间（数据在系统中被处理的时间）之间的关键区别。这为Streaming 101中提出的主要论文提供了基础：如果关心事件实际发生时间，则必须基于事件的事件时间，而不是处理时间。\n接下来介绍了窗口的概念（即沿时间边界切分数据集），这是一种常用的方法，用于应对无限数据源的数据处理，无限数据源理论上永远不会结束。窗口策略的最常见且简单的例子是固定和滑动的窗口，更复杂的窗口类型，例如会话窗口（其中窗口由数据本身的特征决定，捕获每个用户的活动会话窗口，会话窗口之后紧接着是用户的不活动期）也比较广泛的用法。\n除了前文中介绍的概念，现在再介绍3个新的概念：\n\n**水位线：**水位线是相对于事件时间的输入完整性的概念。水位线表示一个时间 X，表示所有事件时间 &lt;X 的所有数据都到齐了。因此，当处理无限数据源时，水位线可以作为进度的度量。\n**触发器：**触发器是一种由外部条件触发、表明何时计算窗口结果的机制。触发器可以让我们灵活的选择何时计算结果并发送给下游，而且随着数据的不停的到来，窗口可以产生多次输出。所以，窗口结束前可以先提供近似结果，并且能够灵活应对上游数据的变化（可能是上游发送的数据修正）或者数据延迟到达（例如，移动场景在某人的离线时，某人的电话记录了各种动作及其事件时间，然后在重新获得连接时继续上传这些事件进行处理）。\n**累积：**累积模式指定在同一窗口中观察到的多个结果之间的关系。这些结果可能完全相互之间完全独立，或者它们之间可能存在重叠。不同的累积模式具有不同的语义和与计算成本，适用于不同的场景。\n\n最后，在回答无限数据处理中的4个问题时，更容易搞清楚这些概念和它们之间的关联关系：\n\n**What****计算的结果是什么？**这个由 Pipeline 中的转换来决定。例如计算总和、构建直方图、训练机器学习模型等等。它也是经典批处理需要回答的问题。\n**Where****在事件时间中的哪个位置计算结果？**这个一般由在 Pipeline 中使用事件时间窗口来决定。这包括从Streaming 101（固定，滑动和会话）窗口的常见示例，和一些貌似没有窗口概念的用例（例如Streaming 101中的时间无关的处理；经典批处理也通常属于此类）以及其他更复杂的窗口类型，如限时拍卖。此外，如果在记录到达系统时将入口时间指定为事件时间，还可以包括处理时间窗口。\nWhen 在处理时间中的哪个时刻触发计算结果？我们通过使用水位线和触发器来回答的这个问题。这里的场景比较多样，但最常见的模式是在给定窗口的输入完成时使用水位线来描绘，触发器允许提前计算结果（对于在窗口完成之前发出的推测性的、部分的结果）和延迟计算结果（水位线只是预估窗口的数据全部到达,并不是100%确定，在水位线声明给定窗口的全部到达之后，也有可能会有隶属于该窗口的数据到达）。\nHow 如何修正结果？这个问题由所使用的累积类型回答：丢弃（其中结果是相互独立和不同的），累积（后来的结果建立在先前的结果上），累积和撤回（当前的累积值和上次触发的值撤回一起发送）。\n\n后边将一一讨论这些问题，试图让大量清楚哪些概念与What/Where/When/How中的哪个问题有关。\nStreaming 101 回顾\n首先，回顾一下Streaming 101中提出的一些概念，这一次还将提供一些具体的例子使这些概念更具体。\nWhat: 变换\n经典批处理中 Transform 解决了以下问题：“要计算什么结果？”许多人可能已经熟悉经典的批处理，所以我们将以它为基础，加入其他概念，以便于理解。\n对于这一部分，我们来看一个示例：计算由10个整数值组成的简单数据集的总和。这么说有点抽象，在实际中，可以想象一个游戏，10个人组成一个团队，每个人的最终得分相加，就是团队的成绩。也可以想象计费和使用情况的监控使用情况这样的场景。\n对于每个示例，将包括一个简短的 Dataflow Java SDK 伪代码片段，以使 Pipeline 的定义更具体。因为是伪代码，所以有时会省略细节（如使用具体的I / O源）、使用简称（Java中的当前触发器名称太冗长）。除了这些（大部分我在 Postscript 中明确列举）的小事情之外，其它基本上是真实的 Dataflow SDK代码。稍后还将提供一个链接到实际的代码演练，可以编译和运行自己的类似例子感兴趣的人，可以实际尝试一下。\n如果熟悉像 Spark Streaming 或 Flink 这样的计算引擎，那么在看 Dataflow 示例代码的时候就会容易一些。接下来开始让人崩溃的旅程，在Dataflow中有两个基本的原语：\n\nPCollection，表示可能要执行并行转换（因此以“P”打头）的数据集。\nPTransform，处理 PCollection 并创建新的 PCollection。PTransform 可以执行元素转换，它们可以将多个元素聚合在一起，或者它们可以是其他 PTransform 的组合。\n\n\n图1. 转换类型\n如果觉得不甚明白或者想刨根问底，可以看看 Google Dataflow Java SDK 文档。\n为了对例子说明，假设我们从一个 PCollection&lt;KV&lt;String，Integer&gt;&gt;命名为“input”（即由一个键/值对的字符串和整数组成的 PCollection，其中字符串是类似团队名称，整数是相应团队中个人的得分）。在现实世界的 Pipeline 中，通过从 I/O 源读取 PCollection 原始数据（例如日志记录）获得输入，将日志记录解析为适当的键/值对，然后将其转换为 PCollection&lt;KV&lt;String，Integer&gt;&gt; 。为了在第一个例子中清楚起见，将包括所有这些步骤的伪代码，但是在随后的例子中，删除了 I/O 和解析部分。\n因此，对于简单地从 I/O 源读取数据的管道，解析出团队/分数键值对，并计算每队的得分数，代码如下：\nPCollection&lt;String&gt; raw = IO.read(...);\nPCollection&lt;KV&lt;String, Integer&gt;&gt; input = raw.apply(ParDo.of(new ParseFn());\nPCollection&lt;KV&lt;String, Integer&gt;&gt; scores = input\n  .apply(Sum.integersPerKey());\n\n清单1. 计算总和的 Pipeline\n从数据源读取键值对数据，键是String类型(团队名称)，值是Integer类型（团队中各人得分）。然后对每个键(团队)计算总和(团队得分)，并输出。\n对于所有的示例，在每个示例的 Pipeline 的代码片段之后，有1个该Pipeline执行的动画示例。动画中看到一个 Key（即一个团队）的10条输入数据执行Pipeline的样子；在一个实际的Pipeline 中，类似的操作将有成千上万个，在很多台机器上并行执行。为了能清晰的说明，示例中演示了1个Key的执行过程。\n动画中每个点代表一个输入或输出数据，输入和输出都有两个时间维度：事件时间（X轴）和处理时间（Y轴）。因此，Pipeline 按照处理时间维度执行，从下向上延伸，如加粗的上升白线所示。输入是圆圈，圆圈内的数字代表该特定记录的值。输入开始是灰色圆圈，随着Pipeline处理变换颜色。\n当 Pipeline 处理到某一个值的时候，会将其累加并记录在 State 中，并最终将聚合结果作为输出。State和输出由矩形表示，矩形顶部不断变化的数字表示累加值，矩形覆盖的区域表示到当前处理时刻，所有矩形中的数据已经被处理。对于清单1中的 Pipeline，在经典批处理引擎上执行时，会看起来像这样（请注意，点击下面的图片启动动画，然后会一直循环播放）：\n\n图2. 经典的批处理\n上边是在批处理引擎上执行Pipeline，累加输入的数据，直到所有输入处理完毕（由顶部的虚线绿色线表示），此时输出为51。在此示例中，因为没有应用任何特定的窗口，所以在事件时间维度上计算了整个数据集的总和；因此，用于累加的State和输出的矩形覆盖X轴的整体。但是，如果要处理一个无限数据源，那么经典批处理将是不够的，不能等待输入结束，因为它实际上永远不会结束。所以需要的使用在Streaming 101中提到的一个概念是---窗口。因此，想要回答第二个问题“在事件时间的哪个位置计算结果？”，现在先简要回顾一下窗口。\nWhere: 窗口\n窗口是把数据在时间上进行切分。常见的窗口策略有：固定窗口、滑动窗口、会话窗口。\n\n图3. 窗口策略\n为了更好地了解实际中的如何使用窗口，来看一下的上边提到的整数求和Pipeline，使用了长度为2分钟的时间窗口。使用 Dataflow SDK，只需要简单的添加 Window.into 转换即可（下面代码中的第二行）：\nPCollection&lt;KV&lt;String, Integer&gt;&gt; scores = input\n  .apply(Window.into(FixedWindows.of(Duration.standardMinutes(2))))\n  .apply(Sum.integersPerKey());\n\n清单2. 使用窗口的求和代码\n回想一下，Dataflow提供了一种统一的批处理和流式处理模型，因为语义上，批处理只是流式处理的一个子集。因此，首先在批处理引擎上执行此Pipeline；在批处理引擎上执行此Pipeline，原理简单明了，可以很好的跟在流式处理引擎上执行做对比。\n\n图4. 批处理上窗口的求和\n如前所述，输入在不断累加存储在State中，直到输入被完全处理，然后产生输出。然而，在这种情况下，不是1个输出，而是4个：在时间上切分成了4个事件时间窗口，每个窗口产生一个输出。\n到此为止，我们重新回顾了Streaming 101中引入的两个主要概念：事件时间和处理时间之间的关系以及窗口。再进一步，开始阐述本节开头提到的新概念：水位线，触发器和累积。下边开始Streaming 102。\nStreaming 102\n在上边我们看到了在批引擎上执行使用了窗口的Pipeline。理想情况下，我们希望具有较低的处理延迟，同时也希望能涵盖对无限数据集的处理。切换到流式引擎是朝着正确方向迈出的一步。批处理引擎可以明确的知道，每个窗口的数据是否完整了（即，有限数据集中所有的数据都被处理了），但目前缺乏确定无限数据集的完整性的实用方法。接下来介绍水位线。\nWhen: 水位线\n水位线是问题答案的前半部分：“在处理时间的什么时候计算窗口的结果？” 水位线是事件时间中输入完整性的时间概念。换句话说，它们是系统根据当前处理的数据的事件时间判断处理进度和完整性的方法（有限或无限数据集，在无限数据的情况下作用更为明显）。\n回想一下 Streaming 101 中这个图，这里稍作修改，其中描述了事件时间和处理时间之间的偏差，现实中大多数的分布式数据处理系统中的时间偏差一直在变化。\n\n图5. 事件时间进度、偏差、水位线\n图中表示现实（reality）的红色曲线本质上是水位线。随着处理时间的推移，它跟踪事件时间完整性的进度。在概念上，可以将水位线视为函数 F(P) -&gt; E，在处理时间中选取一个点，返回事件时间的一个点。（更准确地说，对函数的输入实际上是在 Pipeline 中观察到水位线的点上游的一切的当前状态：输入源，缓冲数据，正在处理的数据等；但在概念上，将其视为从处理时间到事件时间的映射更简单。）在事件时间点 E 上系统会认为事件时间小于 E 的所有数据都到齐了。换句话说，这是一个断言，不再有事件时间小于 E 的数据。根据水位线的类型：完美的或启发式的，这种断言可能是严格的保证或者经过训练的估计：\n\n**理想的水位线：**在完全了解所有输入数据的情况下，可以构建理想的水位线；在这种情况下，没有延迟数据；所有数据都提前或准时到达。\n**启发式水位线：**对于许多分布式输入源，完全了解输入数据是不切实际的，在这种情况下，最佳选择是提供。启发式的水位线使用任何有关输入的信息（分区，分区内排序，文件增长率等），以提供尽可能准确的进度估计。在许多情况下，启发式水位线可以预测的非常准确。即使如此，使用启发式水位线意味着它有时可能是不正确的的，这将导致有些数据被划分为延迟数据。我们将在下面的触发器部分中了解如何处理延迟数据。\n\n水位线是一个有趣和复杂的话题，未来会写一篇新的文章专门阐述。现在，为了更好地了解水位线的作用以及缺点，我们来看一下使用水位线的流式处理引擎的两个例子，以确定何时在清单2中执行使用窗口的Pipeline时实现输出。左边的例子使用理想的水位线；右边的一个使用启发式水位线。\n\n图6. 理想的与推测的水位线\n在这两种情况下，当水位线通过窗口的末尾时，窗口被触发计算。两个执行的主要区别在于右侧的水位线计算中使用的启发式算法，值9因为迟到的问题而没有被计算在内，这大大改变了水位的形状[3]。这些例子突出了水位线的两个缺点：\n\n\n太慢：当任何类型的水位线，由于已知的未处理数据（例如，由于网络带宽约束而缓慢增长的输入日志）被正确地延迟时，如果结果的计算只依赖水位线的触发，将直接导致输出结果的延迟。\n这在左图中是最明显的，即迟到的9阻止所有后续窗口的水位线，即使这些窗口的输入数据已经更早的达到并且是完整的了。第二个窗口[12:02，12:04]尤其明显，从窗口中的第一个值到达到窗口计算并输出结果的时间需要将近七分钟。这个例子中的启发式水位线要稍微好一点（五分钟直到输出），但这不意味着启发式水位线从来不会受到其他水位线滞后的影响；在本例子选择了特殊的数据突出了这种对比。\n这里的重点在于：水位线提供了一个非常有用的完整性概念，从延迟的角度来看，只考虑完整性是不够的。想象一下一个仪表板，显示重要的指标，按小时或天显示。我们不太可能想等待一整个小时或一天才能查看当前窗口的结果；这是使用经典批处理系统为这种系统提供数据的痛点之一。相反，随着输入的演变和最终的完成，这些窗口的结果会随着时间的推移而持续并不断的更新更好一些。\n\n\n**太快：**当一个启发式水位线比实际的水位线更快的向前推进时，会导致原来没有延迟的数据变成了延迟数据。这是在右边的例子中发生的情况：在第1个窗口的输入数据全部到达之前，水位线进入第1个窗口的末尾，导致错误的输出值为5而不是14。这个缺点是严格的启发式水位线的问题；既然是启发式就意味着有时会是错误的。因此，如果关心正确性，单纯依靠水位线确定何时计算结果并发出是不够的。\n\n\n在Streaming 101中，对关于无限数据流的强大的无序处理不足的完整性概念作了一些强调。水位线太慢或太快，是这些论据的基础。完全依赖于完整性概念的系统无法同时获得低延迟和正确性。触发器是解决这些缺点解决方案。\nWhen**: 触发器的伟大之处就在于触发器本身很伟大**\n触发器是问题的另一半答案：“在处理时间的什么时候该计算窗口的结果并发出？”触发器用来表明在处理时间的什么适合该计算窗口的结果（尽管触发器本身可能会根据其他时间触发，例如在事件时间维度上使用水位线）。窗口的每个特定输出都称为窗口的窗格（pane）。\n用于触发的信号的示例包括：\n\n水位线进度（即事件时间进度），是图6中我们已经看到的隐式版本，当水位线通过窗口的末尾时，计算结果并输出[4]。另一个用例是在窗口生命周期的末尾时触发垃圾回收，稍后我们将看到一个例子。\n**处理时间进度，**可以用于提供固定的周期更新，因为处理时间（不像事件时间）总是均匀地，没有延迟地进行。\n元素计数，可以用于在窗口积累固定数量的元素后触发。\n带标记的，或其他数据依赖触发器，即记录或记录的特性（例如，EOF元素或刷新事件）意味着需要产生输出的地方。\n\n除了基于具体信号触发的简单触发器之外，还有复合触发器，允许创建更复杂的触发逻辑。还有些复合触发器：\n\n重复触发器，重复触发器特别适用于处理时间触发器以提供定期更新。\nAND 触发器（逻辑AND），所有子触发器都符合触发条件才触发（例如，在水位线通过窗口结束之后，我们观察到一个终止的标记记录），它才会触发。\nOr 触发器（逻辑或），子触发器中的任何一个符合触发条件都会引起触发（例如，在水位线通过窗口结束之后或我们观察到终止的标记记录）时。\n序列触发器，以子触发器按照预定义的顺序触发子依次触发。\n\n为了使触发器的概念更具体，继续介绍图6中使用的隐式默认触发器，将其添加到清单2中的代码中：\nPCollection&lt;KV&lt;String, Integer&gt;&gt; scores = input\n  .apply(Window.into(FixedWindows.of(Duration.standardMinutes(2)))\n               .triggering(AtWatermark()))\n  .apply(Sum.integersPerKey());\n\n清单3. 显式设定默认触发器\n对触发器能够做什么有了基本的了解，可以开始考虑解决水位线太慢或太快的问题。在这两种情况下，我们希望在水位线超过窗口末尾之前或之后能够有机会计算窗口的结果，并能够提供持续更新的机制（除了水位线超过窗口末尾那一刻）。所以，需要一些多次触发触发器。那么问题就变成了：多次触发用来干什么？\n在太慢的情况下（即提供提前的推测结果），我们可能应该假设任何给定的窗口可能有稳定的输入数据，因为我们知道（通过窗口的早期阶段），我们观察到的这个窗口的输入是非常不完整的。因此，当处理时间提前（例如，每分钟一次）时周期性地触发可能是明智的，因为触发发射的数量将不依赖于实际观察到的窗口的数据量；在最坏的情况下，我们只会得到稳定的定期触发发射。\n在太快的情况下（即，由于启发式水位线可能存在错误的推测，所以需要一种机制去能够处理延时数据去修正计算结果），假设水位线基于相对准确的启发式（通常是相当安全的假设）。在这种情况下，预计不会经常看到延迟很久的数据，但是在实际中确实存在挺多延迟数据，不过结果很快会得到修正。每收到1个延时数据触发一次的策略，能够让我们更快的修正更新计算结果，但是由于预期的后期数据不频繁，应该不会给系统带来大的冲击。请注意，这些只是示例：如果有不同的应用场景，可以自由选择不同的触发器（或选择不适用触发器）。\n最后，我们需要协调这些各种触发器的时间安排：提前，准时和延迟。我们可以使用Sequence 触发器和一个特殊的 OrFinally 触发器组合来实现，OrFinally触发器用来中止这个组合触发器。\nPCollection&lt;KV&lt;String, Integer&gt;&gt; scores = input\n  .apply(Window.into(FixedWindows.of(Duration.standardMinutes(2)))\n               .triggering(Sequence(\n                 Repeat(AtPeriod(Duration.standardMinutes(1)))\n                   .OrFinally(AtWatermark()),\n                 Repeat(AtCount(1))))\n  .apply(Sum.integersPerKey());\n\n清单4. 手动设定提前和推迟触发\n如上所示，伪代码看起来不错，给出了提前、准时、延迟触发的常用模式，对应在 Dataflow 中，提供了一个定制（但语义上相当的）API，使得更容易使用这样的触发器，如下所示：\nPCollection&lt;KV&lt;String, Integer&gt;&gt; scores = input\n  .apply(Window.into(FixedWindows.of(Duration.standardMinutes(2)))\n               .triggering(\n                 AtWatermark()\n                   .withEarlyFirings(AtPeriod(Duration.standardMinutes(1)))\n                   .withLateFirings(AtCount(1))))\n  .apply(Sum.integersPerKey());\n\n清单5. 使用early/late api指定提前和延迟触发\n在流式处理引擎上执行清单4 或清单5 中的示例（包含了理想的水位线和启发式的Watermak），如下所示：\n\n图7. 提前和延迟触发\n这个版本对图6 有两个明显的改进：\n\n对于第二个窗口中的“水位线太慢”的情况，[12:02, 12:04]：我们现在每分钟提供一次定期的提前计算。在理想的水位线案例中，差异最为突出，其中时间到首次输出从近7分钟降至3分半；在启发式案例中也有明显改善。这两个版本现在都可以随着时间的推移而稳定地进行计算和修正计算结果（具有值7,14，然后是22的窗格），降低了从数据输入到得到计算结果之间的延迟。\n对于第一个窗口中的“启发式水位线太快”的情况，[12:00, 12:02]：当9的值延迟到达时，立即将其合并到一个值为14的新的修正的窗格中。\n\n这些新触发器的一个有趣的副作用是，它们有效地使理想和启发式水位线版本之间的输出模式标准化。而图6 中的两个版本是截然不同的，而现在这两个版本看起来很相似。\n此时剩下的最大差异是窗口生命周期。在理想的水位线案例中，当水位线超过窗口末尾后，窗口过期，窗口中的数据再也不会被处理，可以被安全的回收。在启发式水位线案例中，我们仍然需要保留窗口一段时间来处理延迟数据。但是到目前为止，系统没有任何好的方式知道每个窗口需要保留多长时间。这是最大允许延迟的用武之地。\nWhen: 最大允许延迟（超过即可回收）\n在谈到最后一个问题（“如何修正结果？”）之前，先来聊一下持续运行、乱序数据流式处理系统中的实际面对的问题：垃圾收集。在图7 中的启发式水位线示例中，每个窗口的持续状态在该示例的整个生命周期内都会持续；这是必要的，以便在到达时适当地处理延迟数据。但是，尽管能够保留所有持续状态，直到数据全部处理完毕。实际上，当处理无限数据源时，一直保留给定窗口的状态（包括元数据）通常是不切实际；最终会耗尽内存、磁盘等的空间。\n因此，任何现实世界的无序处理系统都需要提供一些限制其正在处理的窗口的生命周期的方法。最简洁的实现方在系统内定义一个最大允许延迟的边界，即限制任何给定记录最晚到达时间（相对于水位线时间）不能超过这个时间；任何超过这个时间的数据不再处理，直接丢弃掉。定义了最大允许延迟之后，还需要准确地确定窗口需要保留的时间：直到水位线超过了窗口的末尾时间+最大允许延迟时间[5]。允许系统丢弃超过最大延迟的数据，还能够节省系统的计算资源。\n由于最大允许延迟和水位线之间的相互作用有点晦涩，举个例子说明一下。我们来看一下清单5 /图7中的启发式水位线 Pipeline，并添加1分钟的最大允许延迟时间（请注意，之所以选择1分钟是为了更好的在图中说明概念，在现实世界中需要根据场景来确定合理的最大允许延迟时间）：\nPCollection&lt;KV&lt;String, Integer&gt;&gt; scores = input\n  .apply(Window.into(FixedWindows.of(Duration.standardMinutes(2)))\n               .triggering(\n                 AtWatermark()\n                   .withEarlyFirings(AtPeriod(Duration.standardMinutes(1)))\n                   .withLateFirings(AtCount(1)))\n               .withAllowedLateness(Duration.standardMinutes(1)))\n  .apply(Sum.integersPerKey());\n\n清单6. 带有最大允许延迟的提前和延迟触发\n这个Pipeline的执行看起来像下面的图8所示，添加了以下功能来突出显示允许的延迟效应：\n\n加粗的水平方向的白线表示当前的处理时间，注释为Lateness Horizon的小刻度表示窗口的最大延时线（事件时间）。\n一旦水位线超过窗口的最大延迟线，该窗口将被回收，这意味着窗口的所有信息都将被销毁。\n虚线的矩形，表示窗口关闭时窗口覆盖的时间范围（在处理时间和事件时间两个维度上），一个小尾巴向右延伸，以表示窗口的延迟水平（与水位线对照）。\n\n在这个图中，为第一个窗口添加了一个额外的延迟数据6。6相对窗口是迟到的，但仍然在允许的最大延迟时间范围内，所以6被累加修正计算结果为11。然而，9 超过了最大允许延迟，直接被丢弃掉。\n\n图8. 提前和推迟触发及允许延迟\n关于最大迟延线的两个最后的说明：\n\n显然，如果从能够提供理想的水位线的资源中获取数据，则无需处理延迟数据，而0秒的最大延迟时间将是最佳的。这是我们在图7 的理想水位线部分中看到的。\n有一些例外情况不需要指定最大延迟，即使在使用启发式的水位线时，比如在数据覆盖的时间的范围内，对有限的key进行统计，（例如，数据覆盖的时间的范围内内，按照Web浏览器分组，统计网站的总访问次数）。在这种情况下，系统中活动窗口的数量受限于使用的Key的数量。只要Key的数量仍然很低，就无须通过设置最大允许的延迟时间来限制窗口的生命周期。\n\n接下来继续讨论第4个也是最后一个问题。\nHow: 累积\n随着时间推移，触发器被用于为一个窗口生成多个窗格，我们发现自己面临最后一个问题：“如何随着时间修正结果？”在我们已经看到的例子中，每个窗格建立在其前一个窗格基础之上。然而，实际上有三种不同的累积方式[6]：\n\n\n丢弃：每当窗格计算完毕时，任何存储的窗口状态都将被丢弃。这意味着每个窗格与之前的窗格都是相互独立的。当下游消费者本身正在执行某种累计时，例如当将整数发送到希望自己计算总和的系统时，丢弃模式是有用的，下游系统将数据累积在一起形成最后的结果。\n\n\n累积：如图7所示，每当窗格计算完毕时，保留该窗格所有的状态，未来输入的数据会累积到并更新现有状态。这意味着窗格是建立在前面窗格的基础之上的。以后的结果可以简单地覆盖以前的结果，例如在诸如BigTable或HBase的键/值存储中存储输出结果时，累积模式很有用。\n\n\n累积和撤回：和累积模式一样，但是当生成新窗格时，同时会为前一个窗格生成1个独立的撤回。撤回（与新的累积结果一起）本质上是在表达，“我以前告诉过你的结果是X，但我错了。撤回我上次告诉你的X，并将其替换为Y.“有两种情况，撤回是特别有用的：\n\n\n\n当下游消费者将不同维度的数据重新分组时，新值可能会与先前的值不同，因此最终会在不同的组中。在这种情况下，新值不能简单的覆盖旧值；需要从旧组中删除旧值，然后将新值添加到新组中。\n当使用动态窗口（例如，后边会有更详细的介绍）时，由于窗口合并，新值可能会替换多个旧窗口。在这种情况下，只从新窗口的信息中难以确定哪些旧窗口中需要撤回。对于旧的窗口进行明确的撤回使得任务变得简单明了。\n\n\n\n放在一起看时，每个类型的累积语义会更清晰。考虑图7中第二个窗口的三个窗格（事件时间范围[12:02，12:04））。下表显示了三个支持的累积模式（每个窗格的值）将在三种支持的累积模式中显示（累积模式是图7中使用的特定模式）：\n\n表1. 使用图7的第二个窗口比较累积模式\n\n**丢弃：**每个窗格仅包含在特定窗格中到达的值。因此，该窗口的最终值是最后一个窗格的值，而不是总和。但是，如果要自己计算所有独立窗格，将得到正确的答案22.这就是为什么丢弃模式下，下游消费者自己在窗格上执行聚合时很有用。\n**累积：**如图7所示，每个窗格包含在该特定窗格中到达的值以及前一个窗格中的所有值。因此，最后一个窗格的值是该窗口所有值的总和22。但是，如果要自己累积该窗口的所有窗格，则会对来自窗格2和窗格1的输入进行双重和三重计数，给出的总和是不正确的51.这就是为什么累积模式是最有用的，可以简单地用新的值覆盖以前的值，新值已经包含了迄今为止收到的所有数据。\n**累积和撤回：**每个窗格都包含一个新的累积模式值以及前一个窗格值的撤回。因此，观察到的最后（非撤回）值以及所有窗格（包括撤回）的总和是正确的答案22.这就是为什么撤回是如此强大。\n\n下边的代码示例了丢弃模式：\nPCollection&lt;KV&lt;String, Integer&gt;&gt; scores = input\n  .apply(Window.into(FixedWindows.of(Duration.standardMinutes(2)))\n               .triggering(\n                 AtWatermark()\n                   .withEarlyFirings(AtPeriod(Duration.standardMinutes(1)))\n                   .withLateFirings(AtCount(1)))\n               .discardingFiredPanes())\n  .apply(Sum.integersPerKey());\n\n清单7. 提前/推迟触发的丢弃模式\n在流式处理引擎上使用启发式水位线的效果如下所示：\n\n图9. 提前/推迟触发的丢弃模式\n虽然输出的整体形状类似于图7的累积模式版本，但请注意，此丢弃版本中的任何一个窗格都不重叠。因此，每个输出与其他输出是独立的。\n如果我们想看撤回的效果，那么这个变化将会是类似的（但是，请注意，Google Cloud Dataflow 的这个功能特性仍在开发中，所以这个API中的命名是临时的，可能与最终发布版本不同）：\nPCollection&lt;KV&lt;String, Integer&gt;&gt; scores = input\n  .apply(Window.into(FixedWindows.of(Duration.standardMinutes(2)))\n               .triggering(\n                 AtWatermark()\n                   .withEarlyFirings(AtPeriod(Duration.standardMinutes(1)))\n                   .withLateFirings(AtCount(1)))\n               .accumulatingAndRetractingFiredPanes())\n  .apply(Sum.integersPerKey());\n\n清单8. 使用提前/延迟触发的累积撤回模式\n在流式处理引擎的执行如下所示：\n\n图10. 提前/推迟触发的累积撤回\n由于每个窗口的窗格都是重叠的，所以看起来有点乱。撤回用红色表示，它与蓝色窗格结合重叠，看起来略带紫色。在一个给定的窗格中略微移动了两个输出的值（并用逗号分隔），使它们更容易区分。\n将图9,7（启发式）和10的三张图动画效果的最终图放在一起，提供了三种模式的很好的视觉对比：\n\n图11. 丢弃模式、累积模式、累积和撤回模式的对比\n从左到右是丢弃模式、累积模式、累积 &amp; 撤回模式，三种模式需要的存储和计算成本依次递增。可以想像，在存储和计算成本方面，呈现的顺序（丢弃，累积，累积 &amp; 撤回）的模式都相继更昂贵。为此，累积提供了一种新的维度，在正确性，延迟和成本的之间进行权衡。\n小结\n到此为止，我们接触了4个问题：\n\n**What：要计算什么结果？**转换操作。\n**Where：在事件时间中的哪个位置计算结果？**由窗口决定。\n**When：在处理时间中的哪个时刻触发计算结果？**由水位线和触发器决定。\n**How：如何修正结果？**通过各种累积模式。\n\n我们目前只了解了一种窗口类型：基于事件时间的固定窗口。 从Streaming 101中我们提到了多种窗口，其中有两个是今天要详细阐述的：基于处理时间的固定窗口，基于事件时间的会话窗口。\n以下链接：https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/60236077\nWhen/Where: 基于处理时间的窗口\n处理时间窗口重要的原因有两个：\n\n对于某些使用情况，例如使用情况监控（例如，Web服务流量的 QPS），希望在收到数据流时分析数据，处理时间窗口绝对是适当的方法。\n对于事件发生时间很重要的（例如，分析用户行为趋势，计费，评分等）的场景，处理时间窗口绝对是错误的选择，要能够清晰的区分哪些场景合适。\n\n因此，值得深入了解处理时间窗口和事件时间窗口之间的差异，特别是考虑到当今大多数流处理系统中广泛使用了处理时间窗口。\n当使用类似于本文中提到的模型时，作为一等公民的窗口是严格基于事件时间的，有两种方法可以用来实现处理时间窗口：\n\n**触发器：**忽略事件时间（即，使用跨越所有事件时间的全局窗口），并使用触发器在处理时间轴中提供该窗口的快照。\n**进入时间：**将进入时间作为数据到达系统的事件时间，并从此开始使用正常的事件时间窗口。 目前 Spark Streaming 就是这么做的。\n\n请注意，这两种方法或多或少等同，但在在多处理步骤Pipeline的情况下略有不同：在触发器版本中，每个处理步骤都使用处理时间切分窗口，步骤之间相互独立，因此例如窗口X中的数据为 一个阶段可能会在下一阶段的窗口 X-1 或 X+1 中; 在进入时间版本中，一旦将数据归于窗口X中，由于不同的处理步骤时间使用水位线同步处理进度（Dataflow的做法），在整个处理过程中都会一直属于窗口X。对微批来说（ Spark Streaming的做法），微批的边界或其他因素，是在引擎级别协调处理。\n正如一直强调的，处理时间窗口的最大缺点是，当输入的顺序发生变化时，窗口的内容会发生变化。 为了更具体地说明这一点，我们来看这三种用例：\n\n事件时间窗口\n使用触发器的处理时间窗口\n使用进入时间的处理时间窗口\n\n我们将每个窗口应用到两个不同的输入数据集（总共有6个变体）。 两个输入数据包含完全相同的事件（即相同的值，发生在相同的事件时间），但顺序不同。 第1个数据集跟我们之前例子中的顺序一致，颜色为白色；第二个数据集调整了事件的处理顺序，如下图12所示，为紫色。\n\n\n图12. 改变了处理时间，其他不变\n基于事件时间的窗口\n为了建立一个基线，我们首先将基于事件时间的使用启发式Watermark的固定窗口处理两个顺序不同的数据集。 我们将重用清单5 / 图7 中的提前/延迟处理的代码，从而得到如下结果。 左边实际上是我们以前看到的; 右边是第二个数据集的结果。 这里要注意的一点是：尽管输出的整体形状不同（由于处理时间不同），四个窗口的最终结果保持不变：14,22,3和12：\n\n图13. 处理时间顺序不同的事件时间窗口\n使用触发器的处理时间窗口\n现在我们来比较上述两种处理时间方法。 首先，将尝试触发器方法。使用处理时间窗口达到效果，需要考虑以下三个方面：\n\n窗口: 使用全局事件时间窗口，本质上是以事件窗格模拟处理时间窗口。.\n触发: 根据处理时间窗口的期望大小，在处理时间维度上周期性触发。\n累积: 使用丢弃模式来保持窗格彼此独立，从而让每个窗格都像一个独立的处理时间窗口。\n\n相应的代码看起来像清单9; 请注意，全局窗口是默认的，因此没有具体的覆盖策略：\nPCollection&lt;KV&lt;String, Integer&gt;&gt; scores = input\n  .apply(Window.triggering(\n                  Repeatedly(AtPeriod(Duration.standardMinutes(2))))\n               .discardingFiredPanes())\n  .apply(Sum.integersPerKey());\n\n清单9. 在全局事件窗口上使用重发触发器、丢弃模式，模拟处理时间窗口\n当流处理引擎上输入两个不同顺序的数据集的时候，结果如下图14所示。关于此图有两点有点意思：\n\n由于我们基于事件时间的窗格模拟处理时间窗口，所以在处理时间轴中勾画了“窗口”，这意味着窗口宽度是在Y轴上度量而不是X轴。\n由于处理时间窗口对输入数据的顺序敏感，在两个数据集中，每个窗口包含的数据都是不同的，即时事件发生的时间相同。 在左边我们得到12,21,18，而在右边我们得到7,36,4。\n\n\n图14. 处理时间顺序不同的处理时间窗口\n使用进入时间的处理时间窗口\n最后，我们来看看通过将输入数据的事件时间映射为入口时间来实现的处理时间窗口。在代码方面，这里有四个方面值得一提：\n\n**时移：**当数据到达时，数据的事件时间被入口时间（数据到达时的处理时间）覆盖。请注意，我们目前在Dataflow中没有标准API来处理时间，尽管我们接下来会可能会使用伪代码I / O源中的虚构方法来代表下面的代码。对于Google Cloud Pub / Sub，只需在发布消息时将消息的timestampLabel字段留空;对于其他来源，需要查阅源代码文档。\n窗口: 返回使用标准的固定事件时间窗口。\n触发: 由于入口时间提供了计算理想Watermark的能力，所以可以使用默认触发器，在这种情况下，当Watermark通过窗口的末尾时，触发器会隐式触发一次。\n**累积模式：**由于我们每个窗口只有一个输出，所以累积模式是无关紧要的。\n\n实际的代码可能是这样：\nPCollection&lt;String&gt; raw = IO.read().withIngressTimeAsTimestamp();\nPCollection&lt;KV&lt;String, Integer&gt;&gt; input = raw.apply(ParDo.of(new ParseFn());\nPCollection&lt;KV&lt;String, Integer&gt;&gt; scores = input\n  .apply(Window.into(FixedWindows.of(Duration.standardMinutes(2))))\n  .apply(Sum.integersPerKey());\n\n清单10. 显式设置默认触发器\n在流式引擎上的执行将如下面的图15所示。当数据到达时，它们的事件时间被覆盖为它们的进入时间（即到达时的处理时间），导致在理想Watermark线上的向右水平移位。该图中有趣的注释：\n\n与其他处理时间窗口示例一样，当输入的顺序变化时，即使输入的值和事件时间保持不变，我们也会得到不同的结果。\n与其他示例不同，窗口在事件时间维度上（因此沿X轴）重新划分了。尽管如此，这些窗口并不是原生的事件时间窗口;而是我们将处理时间简单地映射到事件时间上，擦除每个输入的原始记录，并用新的记录代替它，而事件的时间是表示Pipeline首次收到到数据的时间。\n尽管如此，由于使用了Watermark，触发器仍然在与之前的处理时间示例完全相同的时间触发。此外，所产生的输出值与该示例相同，如左侧的12,21,18，右侧的7,36,4。\n由于使用入口时间，所以理想的Watermark是可能的，所以实际的Watermark与理想的Watermark相匹配，斜率为1，向右上方延伸。\n\n\n图15. 使用入口时间的处理时间窗口，处理两个内容一样但顺序不同的数据集\n虽然看到不同的方法可以实现处理时间窗口很有趣，但是这里的大部分内容是自从第一篇文章以来一直提到的：事件时间窗口与顺序无关，至少在极限情况下如此（实际 在处理过程中的窗格可能会不同，直到输入完成），而处理时间窗口不是。 如果关心事件实际发生的时间，必须使用事件时间窗口，否则计算结果是无意义的。 \nWhere**: 会话窗口**\n现在来看一下我最喜欢的特性之一：动态的、数据驱动的窗口，称为会话窗口。\n会话是一种特殊类型的窗口，它捕获数据中的一段活动，在不活动一段时间后窗口中止。 它们在数据分析中特别有用，因为可以让我们看到某一个特定用户在一段时间内的行为。 这可以让我们分析会话内的活动的相关性，基于会话的长度来推断用户的参与水平等。\n从窗口的角度来看，会话窗口在两个方面很有趣：\n\n它们是数据驱动窗口的示例：窗口的位置和大小是输入数据本身来决定，而不是在时间内基于某些预定义模式，如固定和滑动窗口。\n它们也是不对齐窗口的示例，即窗口并不将数据一视同仁，而是将数据的特定子集（例如，每个用户）进行切分。 这与对齐的窗口（如固定和滑动窗口）形成对比，这些窗口通常对数据一视同仁，进行切分。\n\n对于一些用例，可以提前在一个会话中的数据中标记一个共同标识符（例如，在线的的视频播放器，定时发出心跳包，心跳包内容是服务质量信息，对于任何给定的一次观看，分配一个会话ID，所有的心跳信息中都添加这个会话ID）。在这种情况下，会话更容易构建(按照会话ID区分会话)，本质上是按键分组的一种形式。\n然而，在更一般的情况下（即，实际会话提前并不知道），会话只能从从数据中构建出来。当处理无序数据时，这变得特别棘手。 \n提供一般会话支持的关键是，根据定义，完整的会话窗口是一组较小的重叠窗口的组合，每个窗口包含单个记录，每个记录中的每个记录与下一个记录的间隔不超过预先定义的间隔。因此，即使会话中的数据乱序了，也可以简单地通过将各个数据的重叠窗口合并在一起来构建最终会话。\n\n图16. 未合并的原始会话窗口和合并之后的会话窗口\n下面来看一个代码示例，以清单8中的代码为基础，修改为使用会话窗口：\nPCollection&lt;KV&lt;String, Integer&gt;&gt; scores = input\n  .apply(Window.into(Sessions.withGapDuration(Duration.standardMinutes(1)))\n               .triggering(\n                 AtWatermark()\n                   .withEarlyFirings(AtPeriod(Duration.standardMinutes(1)))\n                   .withLateFirings(AtCount(1)))\n               .accumulatingAndRetractingFiredPanes())\n  .apply(Sum.integersPerKey());\n\n清单11. 基于会话窗口，提前和延迟触发，使用累加和撤销模式\n在流处理引擎上执行如下所示：\n\n图17. 基于会话窗口，提前和延迟触发，使用累加和撤销模式\n上图中的具体过程如下：\n\n当遇到具有值为5的第一个记录时，它被放置在从该记录的事件时间开始的单个原始会话窗口中，窗口宽度为会话窗口的超时时长，例如超时时长为1分钟，会话窗口宽度为1分钟。在后边遇到的任何窗口与该窗口重叠的都应该隶属于同一个会话，并且合并到此窗口中。\n第二个到达记录是7，它类似地放在自己的原始会话窗口中，因为它不与5的窗口重叠。\n同时，Watermark已经过第一个窗口的末尾，所以在12:06之前，包含值5的窗口被物化为准时的窗口。此后不久，当处理时间正好为12:06的时候，第二个窗口也被物化为具有值7的推测结果。\n我们接下来观察一系列的记录，3,4和3，这3个会话窗口相互重叠。因此，它们都被合并在一起，并且在12:07的时候提前触发，发出一个值为10的单个窗口。\n当8到达不久之后，它与具有值7的会话和与值10的会话重叠。所有这三个因此被合并在一起，形成具有值25的新的组合会话。当Watermark然后通过这个会话的末尾时，它物化了一个包含值25的新会话以及之前发布的两个窗口的撤消，但后来被并入它：7和10。\n当9到达延迟到达时，类似的舞蹈发生在9号晚上，与值为5的原始会话，和值为25的会话变成了一个更大的值为39的一个较大的会话。值39和窗口25、5的撤销被立即延迟触发。\n\n就这么简单地将流处理模型分解为不同的、可组合的部分，这还真是了不起啊。至此，你可以将注意力放在业务逻辑上了，而非那些数据形式的细节。\n终于到结尾了，好开心啊\n我讲完了所有的例子。此处应有掌声！您现在应该已经步入了健壮的流处理的世界中了，准备好高飞吧。在您离开之前，我想快速回顾一遍，防止您忘了。首先，我提到了几个重要的概念：\n\n事件时间与处理时间：事件发生时间和被数据处理系统处理的时间之间的重要区别。\n窗口：通常使用的方法是通过在时间边界（通过处理时间或事件时间）对其进行切分来管理无限数据，尽管我们将数据流模型中的窗口定义缩小仅表示事件时间内）。\n水位线：事件时间进度的概念，为在无限数据上运行的乱序处理系统提供了估计窗口数据完整性的手段。\n触发器：用于精确指定在合适计算窗口结果的机制，对于特定用例是有意义的。\n累积：在单个窗口被多次触发计算的情况下，随着触发持续的修正窗口结果。\n\n其次，我们用来构建我们探索的四个问题：\n\nWhat 要计算出什么结果？= 转换\nWhere 事件在哪里结果计算？ = 窗口\nWhen 在处理时间维度上什么时候计算窗口结果？ = 水位线 + 触发器\nHow 如何不断的修正计算结果？= 累积\n\n第三，最后一点，这种流处理模式所带来的灵活性（最终，需要做的是在处理数据的各种要素之间取得平衡，如正确性，延迟和成本），回顾一下，通过少量的代码修改，对相同的数据集处理而得到的输出的变化如下：\n\n感谢您的耐心与兴趣，下次再会！\n","id":"https://wendajiang.github.io/streaming102/","title":"streaming102"},"https://wendajiang.github.io/strip/":{"body":"real-world

'$\\rightarrow$' 是系统中事件的最小关系，满足以下三个条件：\n\n如果$a$和$b$是同一个进程中的事件，而且$a$发生于$b$之前，那么$a \\rightarrow b$\n如果$a$是一个进程中发送消息，$b$是另一个进程中接收消息，那么$a \\rightarrow b$\n如果$a \\rightarrow b$并且$b \\rightarrow c$，那么$a \\rightarrow c$\n\n两个事件$a$和 $b$，如果$a \\nrightarrow b$，而且$b \\nrightarrow a$，就说$a$和$b$是并发的。\n对于任意事件$a$，$a \\nrightarrow a$。这意味着$\\rightarrow$就可以表示系统中所有事件的局部顺序。\n\n图一\n上图对于理解这个定义很有帮助。水平方向表示空间，垂直线表示时间---越高时间越靠后。点表示事件，垂直线表示进程，波浪线表示消息。很容易看出$a \\rightarrow b$在图中意味着$a$可以将消息传递给$b$，比如 $q_1 \\rightarrow r_4$\n$a \\rightarrow b$另一个定义是事件$a$可以影响到$b$。两个事件如果不能互相影响就是并发的。即使我们在图中看出$q_3$在物理时间上早于$p_3$，进程 P 不知道进程 Q 上发生了$q_3$事件，直到$p_4$收到消息（在$p_4$之前，P 进程最多直到 Q 进程将要发生事件$q_3$）\nThis definition will appear quit natural to the reader familiar with the invariant space-time formulation of special relativity, as described for example in [1] or the first chapter of [2]. In relativity, the ordering of events is defined in terms of messages that could be sent. However, we have taken the more pragmatic approach of only considering messages that actually are sent. We should be able to determine if a system performed correctly by knowing only those events which did occur, without knowing which events could have occurred.【这一段不知道怎么翻译。】\nLogical Clocks\n现在我们来将时钟引入系统。我们开始于很抽象的时钟概念，只用来对一个事件赋值一个数值，这个数值被用来表示事件发生的时间。数学的，我们为每个进程$P_i$定义一个时钟$C_i$，函数$C_i \\langle a \\rangle$表示进程中事件$a$的数值。整个系统的时钟通过$C$表示，对于其中的事件$b$的数值使用$C \\langle b \\rangle$表示，当事件$b$属于进程$P_j$，$C\\langle b \\rangle = C_j\\langle b \\rangle$。现在，我们没有将$C_i \\langle a \\rangle$与物理时间绑定起来，所以我们可以将其看做是逻辑时钟而不是物理时钟。他可以使用计数器实现而不需要是时间机制。\n现在我们考虑的意味着系统时钟是正确的。但是我们的定义不能基于物理时间，那样我们必须保证物理时钟。我们的目的是根据事件发生的顺序来定义。最强的合理条件是，如果事件$a$发生于事件$b$之前，我们使用下面的形式表示这种关系：\nClock Condition：对于任意事件$a, b$，如果 $a \\rightarrow b$，则$C\\langle a \\rangle \\lt C\\langle b \\rangle$。\n现在这个条件不可逆，因为那意味着并发事件必须同时发生。在图一中我们看到$p_2,p_3$与$q_3$是并发的，但是这并不表示它们是同时发生的。\nClock Condtion（$\\rightarrow$）满足如下条件：\n\n如果事件$a,b$都是进程$P_i$的，$a$早于$b$，那么$C_i\\langle a \\rangle \\lt C_i\\langle b \\rangle$。\n如果事件$a$是进程$P_i$发送消息，$b$是进程$P_j$接收消息，那么$C_i\\langle a \\rangle \\lt C_j\\langle b \\rangle$\n\n通过 tick 可以将图一划线为图二，条件一意味着同一个进程的两个事件之间要有一条 tick 的线，条件二意味着消息传递线必然与一条 tick 线相交。我们可以调整图二，让 tick 线平行，重画为图三\n\n图二\n\n图三\n读者可以发现，重画后的图三更清晰表明了各进程之间的事件先后关系。\n让我们假定进程就是算法，每个事件是算法的执行命令。我们将阐述如何将时钟引入进程并且满足Clock Condition。进程$P_i$通过$C_i$来表示时钟。\n为了满足Clock Conditon，条件一很容易，只需要满足以下规则\n\nIR1. 进程$P_i$在两个连续事件之间的$C_i$增长\n\n为了满足条件二，我们要求消息$m$包含一个时间戳$T_m$，其等于消息发出的时间。在收到包含时间戳$T_m$的消息时，进程必须保证它的时钟大于$T_m$，数学描述为下面的规则\n\nIR2. 1. 如果事件$a$是进程$P_i$发送消息$m$，消息$m$包含时间戳$T_m = C_i\\langle a \\rangle$\n2. 收到消息$m$的进程$P_j$设置$C_j$大于等于$T_m$\n\n这样就可以确保系统的逻辑时钟是正确的。\nOrdering the Events Totally\n现在我们可以使用满足Cloud Conditon的系统时钟来对系统的所有事件进行全排序。可以简单通过发生时间进行排序。为了避免混淆，我们使用符号$\\prec$表示进程的顺序。为了数学的定义，使用符号$\\Rightarrow$表示：如果事件$a$在进程$P_i$中，事件$b$在进程$P_j$中，$a \\Rightarrow b$当且仅当 (i) $C_i\\langle a \\rangle &lt; C_j\\langle b \\rangle$或者 (ii) $C_i\\langle a \\rangle = C_j\\langle b \\rangle$ 并且 $P_i \\prec P_j$。可以看出如果$a \\rightarrow b$那么$a \\Rightarrow b$。换句话说，符号$\\Rightarrow$是偏序关系$\\rightarrow$在全序中的表示。\n$\\Rightarrow$依赖于系统时钟，不是唯一的，不同的时钟选择会导致不同的$\\Rightarrow$，而偏序关系$\\rightarrow$由系统的事件唯一确定。\n知道事件的全序关系对于实现分布式系统非常重要。事实上，实现系统正确的逻辑时钟就是为了获得这样事件的全序关系。全序关系可以解决下面的问题。一个具有多进程的系统，单一的资源，同一时间只能有一个进程使用这单一资源，必须同步信息以免冲突。我们希望找到一个算法分配这个资源满足三个条件\nI. 一个已经获取这一资源的进程在另一进程获取前释放该资源\nII. 不同进程的资源授权必须按照申请资源的顺序授权\nIII. 如果每个被授权的进程都释放了资源，那么每个请求都被处理了\n我们假定开始该资源被授权给了一个进程。\n这是很自然的条件，并且描述了方案的正确性定义。但是条件二无法说明，并发的两个进程谁先获取资源。\n要意识到这并非一个简单的问题。使用中心进程来按照接收顺序来授权资源是行不通的，除非有一些额外的假设。比如这种情况，$P_0$是调度进程，$P_1$向$P_0$发送了请求，然后向$P_2$发送了消息，$P_2$在没有收到的消息时，$P_2$也发送了请求到$P_0$。$P_2$的请求可以先到达$P_0$，如果先授权资源给了$P_2$，那么条件二不满足了。\n为了解决这个问题，我们实现了规则 IR1 和 IR2 的系统时钟，然后使用这种时钟来对事件进行全排序。这就可以排序资源所有的请求和释放。有了全序，事情就迎刃而解。\n为了简化系统，我们做了一些假设。这些并不是必须的，但是可以避免为了实现细节而分心。我们首先假设任何两个进程$P_i, P_j$，从$P_i$到$P_j$的消息会以发送的顺序被收到。并且，每个消息都能被收到（这两个假设可以避免引入消息序列号和消息协议）。我们还假定一个进程可以向其他所有进程发消息。\n每个进程维护自己的请求队列，这个请求队列并不会被其他进程看到。我们假定请求队列初始化时包含一个消息$T_0$：$P_0$请求资源，$P_0$是初始化被授权资源的进程，$T_0$比任何时钟都小。\n算法可以通过下面的五条规则定义。为了方便，每条规则定义的动作只能构成一个事件。\n\n为了请求资源，进程$P_i$发送消息$T_m$：$P_i$向其他所有进程请求资源，将消息放入自己的请求队列，$T_m$是消息的时间戳\n当进程$P_j$收到消息$T_m$，也将其放入自己的消息队列，回$P_i$一个 ack\n为了释放资源，进程$P_i$从消息队列删除消息$T_m$，然后发送一个$P_i$释放资源的消息给其他所有进程\n当进程$P_j$收到$P_i$释放资源的消息，也将其$T_m$从自己的消息队列删除\n进程$P_i$满足下面两个条件时被授权资源：(1). 消息队列中有$T_m$ (2) 收到了其他所有的进程的消息晚于$T_m$（注意到这两个条件只需要$P_i$自己就可以确定）\n\n证明满足了条件 I~III 还是比价容易。首先，规则 5 的第二点，结合先前消息按序收到的假设，保证了$P_i$在发出请求前已经收到了其他的所有消息。因为规则 3 和 4 只是从请求队列删除消息，容易看出满足了条件 I。条件 II 可以从全序中得出。规则 2 保证了$P_i$请求资源之后，规则 5 的第二点能达到。规则 3 和 4 表明如果一个被授权资源的进程释放了，规则 5 的第一点能达到，所以证明了条件 III\n这是一个分布式算法。每个进程都按照这些规则动作，没有中心进程来协调它们。这个方法可以被扩展为任何多进程中的同步方案。这个同步方案可以被称为State Machine，包含了一系列可能的命令$C$，一系列可能的状态$S$，和一个函数$e：C \\times S \\rightarrow S$。关系$e(C,S)=S'$在状态$S$表示执行命令$C$状态转移为$S'$。我们的例子中，命令$C$包含了$P_i$的所有请求资源和释放资源的命令，状态包含了一个等待请求命令的队列，队列头的请求就是当前被授权的进程。执行一个请求命令在队列尾部入队请求，执行释放命令在头部出队请求。\n每个进程分离的使用所有进程的请求仿真状态机的转移。因为所有进程通过时间戳排序命令，所有进程有相同顺序的命令，所以最终会达成同步状态。一个进程在执行完所有进程小于$T$的命令才会执行$T$的命令。这个算法很清楚，我们不会再解释它。\n但是，这个方案要求所有进程参与进来，一个进程必须获得其他所有进程的命令，任意一个进程出问题，整个系统就会跟着出问题，无法维护状态机。\n这个问题很难解决，这就是本文下面要讨论的。我们要建立在物理时间上下文时的错误概念。没有物理时间，就无法区分一个进程是挂了还是只是偶尔暂停。用户可以在系统只是响应比较慢的时候说系统\"crashed\"了。当单个进程或者消息通信出问题，有方法规避。\nAnomalous Behavior\n我们的资源规划算法通过请求的全序$\\Rightarrow$来解决。这会导致下面的错误行为。考虑一个全国联网的计算机系统，假设一个人在计算机 A 上发出请求 A，然后给另一个城市的朋友打电话让他在计算机 B 上发出请求 B。很有可能请求 B 的时间戳更小，从而排序在 A 之前。系统不知道请求 A 应该在 B 之前，因为排序消息依赖于系统的消息传递。\n让我们剖析这个系统的问题。使用符号$\\varphi$表示系统中的所有事件。让我们引入一个事件集合，包含$\\varphi$中的事件和与其相关联的外部事件，比如上面例子的电话呼叫。仍然使用$\\rightarrow$表示事件集合$\\varphi$中的偏序关系。我们例子中，我们有$A \\rightarrow B$，但是$A \\nrightarrow B$。显然没有算法可以只根据$\\varphi$中的事件来确定$A,B$之间的偏序关系。\n有两种可能的方法来避免这个问题。第一个是在系统中引入确定$\\rightarrow$关系的一些必要信息，在上面的例子中，发出的请求$A$打上时间戳$T_A$，请求$B$的时间戳$T_B$要大于$T_A$。\n第二个是构造一个满足下面条件的系统时钟。\nStrong Clock Condition。对于$\\varphi$中的任意事件$a,b$，如果$a \\rightarrow b$, 则 $C\\langle a \\rangle &lt; C\\langle b \\rangle$\n这个比Clock Condition条件更强。\n宇宙的秘密之一就是，可以构造这种物理时钟，彼此分离的运行，但是却可以满足Strong Clock Condition。\nPhysical Clocks\n让我们将物理时钟与上面的理论结合，让$C_i(t)$表示在物理时间$t$看到的时钟$C_i$，为了数学上的方便，我们假设时钟是连续的而不是按照离散的 tick。数学的描述就是，$C_i(t)$是连续的，这个函数关于$t$的微分$dC_i(t)/dt$表示了在时间$t$时钟的快慢程度。\n为了使得时钟$C_i(t)$与物理时钟尽可能一致，要让其微分尽可能为 1. 数学描述为下面的条件\nPC1. 存在一个常数 $\\kappa \\ll 1$，对于所有的$i$: $|dC_i(t)/dt - 1| \\lt \\kappa$。$\\kappa$的典型值为$10^{-6}$\n然而让所有分离的时钟以正确近似的速率运行是不够的的。它们还必须尽可能同步，对于所有$i,j$来说$C_i(t) \\approx C_j(t)$，同样可以使用小常数来表示\nPC2. 对于所有的$i,j$，$|C_i(t) - C_j(t)| &lt; \\epsilon$\n让我们来使用图二来表征物理时间，图三的画法中，水平线对应的每条进程的值是要小于$\\epsilon$\n因为不可能存在两个完全一致速率运行的时钟，总会发生漂移，我们必须有一个算法使得 PC2 的条件得以满足。首先，我们必须确定两个小常数$\\kappa, \\epsilon$多小才能避免 Anomalous Behavior。我们必须使得系统中的相关物理事件$\\varphi$满足Strong Clock Condition。首先假定进程内的顺序不会有问题，那么我们只用考虑不同进程事件的关系即可。\n一个进程中的事件$a$发生在时间$t$，然后另一个进程中的事件$b$，两个事件满足$a \\rightarrow b$，则$b$发生的时间在$t + \\mu$之后。换句话说，$\\mu$小于进程间通信的时间。我们可以选择$\\mu$等于光速传播最短距离的事件。当然，这取决于系统中的消息如何传递。\n为了规避 Anomalous Behavior，我们必须保证对于任意$i,j,t$，$C_i(t+\\mu) - C_j(t) &gt; 0$。综上，我们可以得出，当时钟被重置的时候，只能往前而不能倒退（倒退会导致 PC1 不满足），PC1 需要 $C_i(t+\\mu) - C_i(t) &gt; (1 - \\kappa)\\mu$，根据 PC2，如果不等式$\\epsilon/(1-\\kappa) \\le \\mu$成立，可以推导出$C_i(t+\\mu) - C_j(t) &gt; 0$。\n不等式和 PC1，2 得到 Anomalous Behavior 不可能发生。\n现在我们描述算法。使用$m$表示在物理时间$t$发送时间$t'$被接收的消息。定义$v_m = t' -t $为消息$m$的延迟。接收消息的进程不知道这个延迟。但是我们假定接收进程知道最小延迟$\\mu_m \\ge 0, \\mu_m \\le v_m$。使用$\\xi_m=v_m - \\mu_m$表示消息的不可预知延迟。\n将 IR1 和 IR2 与物理时钟结合后扩展为 IR1' IR2'\n\nIR1'  对于每个$i$，如果$P_i$在物理时间$t$没有收到消息，则$C_i$在$t$是可微的，并且$dC_i(t)/dt &gt; 0$\nIR2' (a) 如果$P_i$在时间$t$发送了消息$m$，$m$中包含了时间戳$T_m = C_i(t)$ (b) 在进程$P_j$在物理时间$t'$收到消息$m$，将$C_j(t')$设置为$max(C_j(t' - 0), T_m + \\mu_m)$\n\n尽管规则中有物理时间的参数，但是每个进程只需要知道自己的物理时钟读数，以及消息中的时间戳。为了方便数学表述，我们假设了同一进程中的事件不会在同一物理时间发生。\n【译者注：】通过一个数理公式证明了满足 PC2，这里省去翻译，数理公式的证明在 Appendix，同样略去\nConslusion\n定义了\"happened

timestamp)，或称Unix时间(Unix time)、POSIX时间(POSIX time)，是一种时间表示方式，定义为从格林威治时间1970年01月01日00时00分00秒起至现在的总秒数。Unix时间戳不仅被使用在Unix 系统、类Unix系统中，也在许多其他操作系统中被广告采用。\n目前相当一部分操作系统使用32位二进制数字表示时间。此类系统的Unix时间戳最多可以使用到格林威治时间2038年01月19日03时14分07秒（二进制：01111111 11111111 11111111 11111111）。其后一秒，二进制数字会变为10000000 00000000 00000000 00000000，发生溢出错误，造成系统将时间误解为1901年12月13日20时45分52秒。这很可能会引起软件故障，甚至是系统瘫痪。使用64位二进制数字表示时间的系统（最多可以使用到格林威治时间292,277,026,596年12月04日15时30分08秒）则基本不会遇到这类溢出问题。\n首先我们了解一下时间的相关概念，以及之间的区别，需要了解的时间概念有：\n本地时间(locale time)\n格林威治时间（Greenwich Mean Time GMT）\n时间协调时间 （Universal Time Coordinated UTC）\n本地时间，显而易见不用解释了\n先看看时间的标准：\n\n世界时\n世界时是最早的时间标准。在1884年，国际上将1s确定为全年内每日平均长度的1/8.64×104。以此标准形成的时间系统，称为世界是，即UT1。1972年国际上开始使用国际原子时标，从那以后，经过格林威治老天文台本初子午线的时间便被称为世界时，即UT2，或称格林威治时间（GMT），是对地球转速周期性差异进行校正后的世界时。\n原子时\n1967年，人们利用铯原子振荡周期极为规律的特性，研制出了高精度的原子时钟，将铯原子能级跃迁辐射9192631770周所经历的时间定为1s。现在用的时间就是1971年10月定义的国际原子时，是通过世界上大约200多台原子钟进行对比后，再由国际度量衡局时间所进行数据处理，得出的统一的原子时，简称TAI。\n世界协调时\n世界协调时是以地球自转为基础的时间标准。由于地球自转速度并不均匀，并非每天都是精确的86400原子s，因而导致了自转时间与世界时之间存在18个月有1s的误差。为纠正这种误差，国际地球自转研究所根据地球自转的实际情况对格林威治时间进行增减闰s的调整，与国际度量衡局时间所联合向全世界发布标准时间，这就是所谓的世界协调时（UTC:CoordinatdeUniversalTime）。UTC的表示方式为：年（y）、月（m）、日（d）、时（h）、分（min）、秒（s），均用数字表示。\n\nGPS 系统中有两种时间区分，一为UTC，另一为LT（地方时）两者的区别为时区不同，UTC就是0时区的时间，地方时为本地时间，如北京为早上八点（东八区），UTC时间就为零点，时间比北京时晚八小时，以此计算即可\n通过上面的了解，我们可以认为格林威治时间就是时间协调时间（GMT=UTC），格林威治时间和UTC时间均用秒数来计算的。\n而在我们平时工作当中看到的计算机日志里面写的时间大多数是用UTC时间来计算的，那么我们该怎么将UTC时间转化为本地时间便于查看日志，那么在作程序开发时又该怎么将本地时间转化为UTC时间呢？\n下面就介绍一个简单而使用的工具，就是使用linux/unix命令date来进行本地时间和local时间的转化。\n大家都知道，在计算机中看到的utc时间都是从（1970年01月01日 0:00:00)开始计算秒数的。所看到的UTC时间那就是从1970年这个时间点起到具体时间共有多少秒。\n我们在编程中可能会经常用到时间，比如取得系统的时间（获取系统的年、月、日、时、分、秒，星期等），或者是隔一段时间去做某事，那么我们就用到一些时间函数。\nLinux 中的时间函数\nlinux下存储时间常见的有两种存储方式，一个是从1970年到现在经过了多少秒，一个是用一个结构来分别存储年月日时分秒的。\ntime_t 这种类型就是用来存储从1970年到现在经过了多少秒，要想更精确一点，可以用结构struct timeval，它精确到微妙。\nstruct timeval {\n  long tv_sec; //秒\n  long tv_usec; //微秒\n};\n\n而直接存储年月日的是一个结构：\nstruct tm\n{\n    int tm_sec;  /*秒，正常范围0-59， 但允许至61*/\n    int tm_min;  /*分钟，0-59*/\n    int tm_hour; /*小时， 0-23*/\n    int tm_mday; /*日，即一个月中的第几天，1-31*/\n    int tm_mon;  /*月， 从一月算起，0-11*/  1+p-&gt;tm_mon;\n    int tm_year;  /*年， 从1900至今已经多少年*/  1900＋ p-&gt;tm_year;\n    int tm_wday; /*星期，一周中的第几天， 从星期日算起，0-6*/\n    int tm_yday; /*从今年1月1日到目前的天数，范围0-365*/\n    int tm_isdst; /*日光节约时间的旗标*/\n};\n/*需要特别注意的是，年份是从1900年起至今多少年，而不是直接存储如2011年，月份从0开始的，0表示一月，星期也是从0开始的， 0表示星期日，1表示星期一。*/\n\n下面介绍常用时间函数\n#include &lt;time.h&gt;\nchar *asctime(const struct tm* timeptr);

世界时\n世界时UT，可以简单理解为按照地球自转一周来计量24小时的时间标准，由于地球自转速率的变化，世界时的秒长会有微小的变化，每天的快慢可以达到千分之几秒。\n2.1 TAI时间\n世界时不准，因此国际组织定义了TAI时间,即国际原子时（ International Atomic Time），其起点是1958年的开始（世界时UT），以铯原子钟走秒连续计时的时间。\n2.2 UTC时间\n计算机网络普遍使用的UTC时间（协调世界时,Coordinated Universal Time），由国际计量局BIPM综合全世界多个守时实验室的钟组计算得到，为了使UTC时间与地球自转1天的时间（世界时UT）协调一致，每隔1到2年， BIPM会通告在UTC时间6月30日或12月31日最后一分钟“加一秒”或“减一秒”等闰秒调整。也就是说，UTC时间会出现60秒或少了59秒的情况。\n最近一次闰秒是UTC时间2015年6月底：\n\n2015 年6月30日，23时 59分 59秒\n2015 年6月30日，23时 59分 60秒\n2015 年7月 1日， 0时 0分 0秒\n\n由于存在闰秒，UTC时间与TAI时间是有差别的，UTC = TAI - n，这个n现在（2016年1月）是36秒，也就是说UTC时间比TAI时间慢了36秒。\n2.3 北京时间\n北京时间也就是东八区时间，在UTC时间基础上加8小时，中国的北京标准时间由位于陕西的国家授时中心发播。\n2.4 GPS时间\n由GPS系统通过卫星信号发播的原子时间，GPS时间用自1980年1月6日零点（UTC时间）起的星期数和该星期内内的秒数来表示。\n工程上，GPS接收机会根据闰秒数将GPS时间换算为我们通常使用的UTC时间。GPS时间的源头是美国海军天文台的守时原子钟组。\n2.5 北斗（BDS）时间\n由北斗卫星导航系统通过卫星信号发播的原子时间，同样，北斗接收机会根据闰秒数将北斗时间换算为我们通常使用的UTC时间。\n北斗时间的时钟源是位于北京的解放军时频中心的守时原子钟组，陕西的国家授时中心好尴尬:(。\n2.6 频率\n时间的导数就是频率，机械发条、石英晶体振荡器、原子钟等各种时钟源通过产生频率信号，按照频率均匀打拍计数，模拟时间的等间隔流逝，就有了可见的“时间”。\n2.7 频率准确度\n手表有准和不准的，反映的就是频率准不准，时钟频率和标准频率的偏差可以用频率准确度来衡量。1E-9量级表示1秒会差1ns，我们使用的个人电脑，它的守时时钟是个32. 768kHz的石英晶振，准确度大概只有2E-5量级（20ppm），也就是说1秒会差0.02ms，1天会跑偏大概2秒。\n2.8 时间同步\n广义的“时间同步”包括的时间和频率的同步。上级时钟将时间频率信号通过各种有线（以太网、SDH数字网、同轴电缆、电话等）、无线（卫星、长波、电台、微波、WIFI、Zigbee等）链路传递给下级时钟，下级时钟接受时间频率信息后，与上级时钟保持相位、频率的一致。\n3.时间同步原理\n3.1 单向授时\n上级时钟主动发播时间信息，下级用户端被动接受时间信息，并调整本地时钟使时差控制在一定范围内。\n要想提高授时精度，用户端必须计算出时间信息在传播链路中的延时，GPS/北斗等卫星授时，可以通过用户端定位与卫星之间距离确定电磁传输延时，消除大部分误差，而电缆、网络等如果是单向授时方式就无法准确计算单向链路时延了。\n3.2 双向授时\n用户端将接受的时间信息原路返回给上级时钟服务端，服务端将往返时间除以二即得到单向链路时延，再把单向时延告诉客户端，在此基础上，客户端得到服务端更准确的时间信息。比如：北斗单向卫星授时精度100ns，双向卫星授时精度可做到20ns。\n3.3 网络时间同步\n网络时间同步，特指在计算机网络内的服务器与客户端之间利用网络报文交换实现的时间同步。\n鉴于计算机网络传输路径的不确定性和中间路由交换设备转发报文时间的不确定性，通过单播或多播实现的单向网络授时是不可靠的。因此，前辈们发明的网络时间同步技术NTP/PTP等，基本原理都是通过对网络报文打时间戳（标记），往返交换报文计算传输时延和同步误差。\n3.4 频率同步\n频率同步指的是主从时钟的频率误差保持在一定范围内，频率同步有2种类型:\n第1种是直接传递模拟频率信号，比如用电缆或光缆传递10MHz、5Mhz、2.048MHz等标准频率，或者传递bit位宽脉冲；\n第2种是通过测量得到的主从时钟时差，通过锁定主从相差实现频率锁定（PLL），或者间接计算频率偏差，完成频率修正。\n4.计算机网络时间同步\n计算机网络时间同步只是时间同步的一种应用场景，其时间传递的链路可能是SDH网、以太网、WIFI无线网络等。\n4.1 NTP\nNTP（Network Time Protocol）从1985年诞生来，目前仍在在大部分的计算机网络中起着同步系统时间的作用。\n\n基本原理\n\n\n服务器和客户端之间通过二次报文交换，确定主从时间误差，客户端校准本地计算机时间，完成时间同步，有条件的话进一步校准本地时钟频率。\n\n\n时间同步过程\n\n\n服务器在UDP的132端口提供授时服务，客户端发送附带T1时间戳（Timestamp）的查询报文给服务器，服务器在该报文上添加到达时刻T2和响应报文发送时刻T3，客户端记录响应报到达时刻T4。\n\n贴个维基的图：\n\n\n\n\n时差计算\n\n\n维基这个图中用蓝色标注了主从直接来回链路的时延Sigma：\nSigma = (t4-t1)-(t3-t2)\n因此，假设来回网络链路是对称的，即传输时延相等，那么可以计算客户端与服务器之间的时间误差Delta为：\nDelta = t2-t1-Sigma/2=((t2-t1)+(t3-t4))/2\n客户端调整自身的时间Delta，即可完成一次时间同步。\n\n\n计时方式\n\n\nNTP采用UTC时间计时，NTP时间戳包括自1900-01-01 00:00:00开始的UTC总秒数，当前秒的亚秒数。\n当正闰秒时，60秒和下一分钟的0秒的NTP总秒数一致的，因此NTP报文专门定义了闰秒指示域来提示。\n\n\n误差分析\n\n\n局域网内计算机利用NTP协议进行时间同步，时间同步精度在5ms左右，主要误差包括：\n\n1）计算机打时间戳的位置在应用层，受协议栈缓存、任务调度等影响，不能在网络报文到来时马上打戳；\n2）各种中间网络传输设备带来的传输时延不确定性以及链路的不对称性，将进一步降低NTP时间同步精度。\n\n\n4.2 PTP\n为克服NTP的各种缺点，PTP(Precision Time Protocol，精确时间同步协议)应运而生，最新协议是IEEE1588v2，可实现亚微秒量级的时间同步精度。\n\n基本原理\n\n\n主从节点在网络链路层打时间戳，利用支持IEEE1588协议的PHY片，精准记录时间同步网络报文接受或发送的时刻。交换机、路由器等网络中间节点准确记录时间同步报文在其中停留的时间，实现对链路时延的准确计算。\n\n\n时间同步过程\n\n\nPTP默认使用组播协议，二层或四层UDP组播都可以，一般我们使用基于UDP组播，使用319和320两个端口。\nPTP定义了三种角色：OC、BC和TC。我们一般接触的是OC：主时钟和从时钟，交换机、路由器一般是BC或TC。\n由于硬件性能有限，网络报文发送时记录的时刻信息，可以在随后的Follow_Up跟随报文中发出，这就是PTP的双步模式(Two-step)。\n\n下图是两OC主从时钟之间的同步过程：\n\n\n\na.主时钟向从时钟发送Sync报文，并在本地记录发送时间t1；从时钟收到该报文后，记录接收时间t2。\nb.时钟发送Sync报文之后，紧接着发送一个携带有t1的Follow_Up报文。\nc.从时钟向主时钟发送Delay_Req报文，用于发起反向传输延时的计算，并在本地记录发送时间t3；主时钟收到该报文后，记录接收时间t4。\nd.主时钟收到Delay_Req报文之后，回复一个携带有t4的Delay_Resp报文。\n\n\n\n时差计算\n\n\n与NTP一样的原理，从时钟根据拥有的t1～t4这四个时间戳，由此可计算出主、从时钟间的往返总延时为：\nSigma = (t4-t1)-(t3-t2)\n假设网络是对称的，从时钟相对于主时钟的时钟偏差为：\nDelta = t2-t1-Sigma/2=((t2-t1)+(t3-t4))/2\n\n\n计时方式\n\n\n与NTP不同，PTP采用TAI世界原子时间计时，而且PTP计时的起点与unix时间一致，即UTC时间1970年1月1日0点。\nPTP主钟会告知从钟，当前UTC相对于TAI的累计偏移量，从钟据此计算当前准确的UTC时间。\n\n\n误差分析\n\n\nPTP能准确记录报文发送和接受的时间，也能计算中间链路的延时，剩下影响最大的就是网络链路的不对称性了。\n在实际工程中，网络中间链路设备不支持PTP协议，大大降低了PTP的同步精度。目前，PTP主要应用在通信同步网、电力同步网等行业网络系统里。\n\n\n同步拓扑\n\n\nPTP域中所有的时钟节点都按一定层次组织在一起，可通过BMC（Best Master Clock，最佳主时钟）协议动态选举出最优时钟，最优时钟的时间最终将被同步到整个PTP域中。\nBMC算法与STP（Spaning Tree Protocl）生成树协议类似，最终形成无环路的树形网络拓扑，且都是动态选举，能适应最佳主时钟切换的变化。\n\n\n扩展应用——PTP over SDH\n\n\n充分利用各行业已有的SDH通信网络，利用PTP-E1信号转换设备，架设PTP同步网络，除了需要考虑链路倒换问题之外，SDH网络的时延稳定性可大幅提升网络时间同步精度。\n\n4.3 SyncE同步以太网\n以太网最早只能传输数据信号，有另外独立的频率同步网络，随着以太网的快速发展，SyncE（Synchronized Ethernet）同步以太网技术诞生后，企业们有了新的选择。\n\n基本原理\n\n\n时钟节点利用以太网（1000M、1G、10G等）物理层的空闲间隙，传递位宽时钟信号，实现时钟频率信号（25M、125M等）的自上而下传递。\n\n\n协议控制\n\n\n类似于SDH网络等时间间隔传递的SSM同步状态信息，同步以太网（Sync-E）利用链路层ESMC协议封装传递SSM信息，SSM信息包含时钟质量信息，接收端据此选择合适的上级网络时钟。\n\n\n应用\n\n\n一般商业PHY片提供SyncE功能选项，开启该功能模式，即可利用PHY恢复出来的频率信号，校准本地时钟频率或分频后用于本地计时。\n\nNTP原理及工作模式\nNTP（Network Time Protocol，网络时间协议）是由RFC 1305定义的时间同步协议，用来在分布式时间服务器和客户端之间进行时间同步。NTP基于UDP报文进行传输，使用的UDP端口号为123。\n使用NTP的目的是对网络内所有具有时钟的设备进行时钟同步，使网络内所有设备的时钟保持一致，从而使设备能够提供基于统一时间的多种应用。\n对于运行NTP的本地系统，既可以接收来自其他时钟源的同步，又可以作为时钟源同步其他的时钟，并且可以和其他设备互相同步。\nNTP工作原理\nNTP的基本工作原理如图所示。Device A和Device B通过网络相连，它们都有自己独立的系统时钟，需要通过NTP实现各自系统时钟的自动同步。为便于理解，作如下假设：\n在Device A和Device B的系统时钟同步之前，Device A的时钟设定为10:00:00am，Device B的时钟设定为11:00:00am。\nDevice B作为NTP时间服务器，即Device A将使自己的时钟与Device B的时钟同步。\nNTP报文在Device A和Device B之间单向传输所需要的时间为1秒。\n\n系统时钟同步的工作过程如下：\nDevice A发送一个NTP报文给Device B，该报文带有它离开Device A时的时间戳，该时间戳为10:00:00am（T1）。\n当此NTP报文到达Device B时，Device B加上自己的时间戳，该时间戳为11:00:01am（T2）。\n当此NTP报文离开Device B时，Device B再加上自己的时间戳，该时间戳为11:00:02am（T3）。\n当Device A接收到该响应报文时，Device A的本地时间为10:00:03am（T4）。\n至此，Device A已经拥有足够的信息来计算两个重要的参数：\nNTP报文的往返时延Delay=（T4-T1）-（T3-T2）=2秒。\nDevice A相对Device B的时间差offset=（（T2-T1）+（T3-T4））/2=1小时。\n这样，Device A就能够根据这些信息来设定自己的时钟，使之与Device B的时钟同步。\nNTP的报文格式\nNTP有两种不同类型的报文，一种是时钟同步报文，另一种是控制报文。控制报文仅用于需要网络管理的场合，它对于时钟同步功能来说并不是必需的，这里不做介绍。\n\n主要字段的解释如下：\n\nLI（Leap Indicator）：长度为2比特，值为“11”时表示告警状态，时钟未被同步。为其他值时NTP本身不做处理。\nVN（Version Number）：长度为3比特，表示NTP的版本号，目前最新版本为3。\nMode：长度为3比特，表示NTP的工作模式。不同的值所表示的含义别是：0未定义、1表示主动对等体模式、2表示被动对等体模式、3表示户模式、4表示服务器模式、5表示广播模式或组播模式、6表示此报文为TP控制报文、7预留给内部使用。\nStratum：系统时钟的层数，取值范围为1～16，它定义了时钟的准度。层数为1的时钟准确度最高，准确度从1到16依次递减，层数为16时钟处于未同步状态，不能作为参考时钟。\nPoll：轮询时间，即两个连续NTP报文之间的时间间隔。\nPrecision：系统时钟的精度。\nRoot Delay：本地到主参考时钟源的往返时间。\nRoot Dispersion：系统时钟相对于主参考时钟的最大误差。\nReference Identifier：参考时钟源的标识。\nReference Timestamp：系统时钟最后一次被设定或更新的时间。\nOriginate Timestamp：NTP请求报文离开发送端时发送端的本时间。\nReceive Timestamp：NTP请求报文到达接收端时接收端的本地间。\nTransmit Timestamp：应答报文离开应答者时应答者的本地时间。\nAuthenticator：验证信息。\n\nNTP的工作模式\n设备可以采用多种NTP工作模式进行时间同步：\n客户端/服务器模式\n对等体模式\n广播模式\n组播模式\n用户可以根据需要选择合适的工作模式。在不能确定服务器或对等体IP地址、网络中需要同步的设备很多等情况下，可以通过广播或组播模式实现时钟同步；客户端/服务器和对等体模式中，设备从指定的服务器或对等体获得时钟同步，增加了时钟的可靠性。\n\n客户端/服务器模式\n\n\n在客户端/服务器模式中，客户端向服务器发送时钟同步报文，报文中的Mode字段设置为3（客户模式）。服务器端收到报文后会自动工作在服务器模式，并发送应答报文，报文中的Mode字段设置为4（服务器模式）。客户端收到应答报文后，进行时钟过滤和选择，并同步到优选的服务器。\n在该模式下，客户端能同步到服务器，而服务器无法同步到客户端。\n\n对等体模式\n\n\n在对等体模式中，主动对等体和被动对等体之间首先交互Mode字段为3（客户端模式）和4（服务器模式）的NTP报文。之后，主动对等体向被动对等体发送时钟同步报文，报文中的Mode字段设置为1（主动对等体），被动对等体收到报文后自动工作在被动对等体模式，并发送应答报文，报文中的Mode字段设置为2（被动对等体）。经过报文的交互，对等体模式建立起来。主动对等体和被动对等体可以互相同步。如果双方的时钟都已经同步，则以层数小的时钟为准\n\n广播模式\n\n\n在广播模式中，服务器端周期性地向广播地址255.255.255.255发送时钟同步报文，报文中的Mode字段设置为5（广播模式）。客户端侦听来自服务器的广播报文。当客户端接收到第一个广播报文后，客户端与服务器交互Mode字段为3（客户模式）和4（服务器模式）的NTP报文，以获得客户端与服务器间的网络延迟。之后，客户端就进入广播客户端模式，继续侦听广播报文的到来，根据到来的广播报文对系统时钟进行同步。\n\n组播模式\n\n\n在组播模式中，服务器端周期性地向用户配置的组播地址（若用户没有配置组播地址，则使用默认的NTP组播地址224.0.1.1）发送时钟同步报文，报文中的Mode字段设置为5（组播模式）。客户端侦听来自服务器的组播报文。当客户端接收到第一个组播报文后，客户端与服务器交互Mode字段为3（客户模式）和4（服务器模式）的NTP报文，以获得客户端与服务器间的网络延迟。之后，客户端就进入组播客户模式，继续侦听组播报文的到来，根据到来的组播报文对系统时钟进行同步。\nNTP 详解\n一、NTP协议简介\n网络时间协议NTP(Network Time Protocol)的主要开发者是美国特拉华大学的MILLS David L教授设计实现的，由时间协议、ICMP时间戳消息及IP时间戳选项发展而来。NTP用于将计算机客户或服务器的时间与另一服务器同步，使用层次式时间分布模型。在配置时，NTP可以利用冗余服务器和多条网络路径来获得时间的高准确性和高可靠性。即使客户机在长时间无法与某一时间服务器相联系的情况下,仍可提供高准确度时间。\n实际应用中，还有确保秒级精度的简单的网络时间协议SNTP(Simple Network Time Protocol)。SNTP是NTP的一个子集,主要用于那些不需要NTP的精度以较高实现复杂性的网络时间同步客户机。SNTP协议已减少了网络延时对校对准确的影响，但没有冗余服务器和校正时钟频率误差功能。\n一般的计算机和嵌入式设备在时钟度方面没有明确的指标要求, 时钟精度只有10-4～10-5，每天可能误差达十几秒或更多，如果不及时校正，其累积时间误差不可忽视。许多工业控制过程需要高准确度时间，如：电力系统内众多的计算机监控系统、保护装置、故障录波器等时间同步要在ms级以内。\n联网计算机同步时钟最简便的方法是网络授时。网络授时分为广域网授时和局域网授时。广域网授时精度通常能达50ms级，但有时超过500ms，这是因为每次经过的路由器路径可能不相同。现在还没有更好的办法将这种不同路径延迟的时间误差完全消除。局域网授时不存在路由器路径延迟问题，因而授时精度理论上可以提到亚毫秒级。Windows内置NTP服务，在局域网内其最高授时精度也只能达10ms级。因此，提高局域网NTP授时精度成为一个迫切需要解决的问题。\n二、NTP授时原理\nNTP最典型的授时方式是Client/Server方式。如下图1所示，客户机首先向服务器发送一个NTP 包，其中包含了该包离开客户机的时间戳T1，当服务器接收到该包时，依次填入包到达的时间戳T2、包离开的时间戳T3，然后立即把包返回给客户机。客户机在接收到响应包时，记录包返回的时间戳T4。客户机用上述4个时间参数就能够计算出2个关键参数：NTP包的往返延迟d和客户机与服务器之间的时钟偏差t。客户机使用时钟偏差来调整本地时钟，以使其时间与服务器时间一致。\n如图：Client/Server方式下NTP授时原理\n\nT1为客户发送NTP请求时间戳(以客户时间为参照)；T2为服务器收到NTP请求时间戳(以服务器时间为参照)；T3为服务器回复NTP请求时间戳(以服务器时间为参照)；T4为客户收到NTP回复包时间戳(以客户时间为参照)；d1为NTP请求包传送延时，d2为NTP回复包传送延时；t为服务器和客户端之间的时间偏差，d为NTP包的往返时间。\n$\\left{               \\begin{array}{lr}               T2 = T1 + t + d1 &amp;  \\               T4 = T3 - t + d2 \\               d = d1 + d2                 \\end{array}   \\right.  $\n假设NTP请求和回复包传送延迟相等，即$$d1 = d2$$，可以得到\n$\\left{               \\begin{array}{lr}              t = \\frac{(T2 - T1) - (T4 - T3)}{2}  \\               d = (T2 - T1) + (T4 - T3)                \\end{array}   \\right.  $\n=&gt; $$t = (T2 - T1) + d1 = (T2 - T1) + \\frac{d}{2}$$\n可以得出，t、d只与T2、T1差值及T3、T4差值相关，而与T2、T3差值无关，即最终结果与服务器处理请求时间所需时间无关。因此，客户端可以根据差值计算时差来调整本地时钟。\n三、NTP授时精度分析\nNTP授时精度与NTP服务器与用户间的网络状况有关，主要取决于NTP包往返路由的延时对称程度，往返路由的延时不对称值最大不超过网络延时。式(2)是在假设NTP请求和回复包在网上传送延时相等，即d1=d2=d/2的情况下得出的，而d1、d2的取值范围在(0...d)间，由式(3)可以得出最大授时误差是±d/2。一般广域网的网络延时在10 ms～500ms之间;局域网的网络延时在计时操作系统内核处理延迟的情况下通常小于1ms。\n假定局域网内NTP延时小于1ms，理论上授时误差小于0.5ms，但对于Windows操作系统内置的NTP客户和NTP服务，并不能达到此精度。Windows NTP时钟分辨率因操作系统和硬件不同而有所不同，时钟分辨率通常为10ms或15ms。基于Windows操作系统内置的NTP授时精度最高不超过10ms。\n四、基于NTP减少计算机时钟偏差\n01、计算机时钟偏差分析\n通用PC机自带两类时钟源：硬件时钟和软件时钟(或称为系统时钟)。不论是硬件时钟还是软件时钟，都是由石英晶体振荡器驱动的，通过累计石英晶体振荡器输出脉冲数，换算出时间。所以计算机时钟的准确度取决于晶振频率准确度。受温度变化、电压、芯片老化等因素影响，晶振频率会发生小幅度波动，其中温度对晶振频影响最大。\n由于工艺和材料的原因，同一生产线上标称频率相同的石英晶体，其实际频率是不同的，实际频率与标称频率偏差率从10-4量级到10-9量级不等。以10-4量级为例，时钟每天至少误差8.64 s。\n02、基于NTP减少计算机时钟频率偏差\n时钟频率偏差是时钟长期计时累积误差的主要原因，要提高时钟长期计时精度，必须补偿时钟频率偏差。联网的计算机可采用NTP方式,可非常方便地校准时钟频率偏差。以NTP服务器时钟为标准时间，在某一时刻设置NTP客户机时间为NTP服务器当前时间T0，经过一段时间后，NTP服务器时间为T0+tsn，NTP客户端时间为T0+tcn。因为存在时钟频率偏差，tsn与tcn并不相等。NTP客户端时间tcn需乘以时钟频率偏差系数k才等于tsn，即tsn=k×tcn，所以k=tsn/tcn。\n任何晶振实际工作频率都是不稳定的，只是程度不同而已。即使温度补偿的晶振，在常温范围内(摄氏10℃～35℃)也有大约5×10-7～2×10-6的误差。晶振实际频率是受外界多种因素(温度、电压、老化等)影响而改变的。因此，时钟频率偏差系数k并非恒定不变的。每隔一定时间，NTP客户机要对时钟频率偏差系数k进行校正，才能保证计时精度。\n五、进一步提高NTP授时精度的方法\n局域网络延相对较大的原因在于时间戳一般都是在应用层加盖。为减少操作系统内核处理延时的影响提高NTP授时精度，发/收NTP包时间戳应尽量接近主机真实发/收包时刻。在不改变硬件的条件下，一个可行的办法是修改网卡驱动程序，将记录NTP包发/收时间戳从应用程序移至网卡驱动程序处，可消除操作系统内核处理延时不确定而引入的误差。这种方法在局域网中可大幅提高NTP授时精度至μs级。\n为了减少温度引起晶振频率漂移对时钟准确度的影响，可以采用数字温漂补偿方法，提高时钟长期计时准确度。先测出工作温度范围内温度对应的温漂补偿系数，工作时每隔一定时间，根据实际温度查出对应补偿系数动态地修正时间。\n时钟频率偏差和时钟分辨率低是局域网NTP授时精度不高的主要原因。\n更新记录\n2021-05-07

方便查阅）\n常备小药箱\n\n\n\n\n文章介绍几种常用药\n讲到用药，避不开的是用药的时机和环节。在此基于历史经验及业内常规流程，将用药程序拆分为以下三阶段：\n\n\n到家。即将进行小乌龟的身体评估及初步安置（我不想用“调理”这个字眼，见谅）\n\n\n日常饲养。包括小打小闹的外伤、气候变迁的不适应等情况\n\n\n生病时。请注意疾病的鉴别诊断是一定要在全面分析下进行的，并不是小乌龟拉一个白便就等同肠炎这么简单。\n\n\n疾病不明或临终关怀时。\n\n\n因为本文仅涉及日常常备药物，具体针对治疗环节的药物请期待后续各病种详细内容，在此不必展开。\n正文开始\n\n口服补液盐III\n\n\n\n\n用途：新龟到家补水、拉稀龟补液、脱水/肾功能bug的龟补液/外伤干养补液/一般疾病补液\n\n\n用法：口服/浸泡，依照说明书比例即可。\n\n\n上位替代品：乳酸林格氏液\n\n\n下位替代品：宝矿力水特\n\n\n2.益生菌\n益生菌这个话题似乎触动了许多半水养殖者的内心。用什么，怎么用，什么用处，似乎没有人给各位龟友逐一说明，甚至只是疯狂推荐一拥而上。实际上，不同场景需要的菌种是不一样的。\n\n没用过抗生素且正常饲养的小乌龟，日常喂养添加益生元即可，培养小乌龟本身的菌群壮大比什么都靠谱。日常添加益生元：菊粉、低聚果糖、低聚木糖、水苏糖等等。\n在半水龟绕不开的原虫环节，我建议丁酸梭菌/布拉迪酵母菌与打原虫的甲硝唑一起服用。因为这两种菌对甲硝唑并不敏感，不必担心失活。\n在低温、喂食难消化的食物时候，建议添加复合益生菌。（市面上符合益生菌太多了没必要举例，反正乳酸菌/双歧杆菌难以定植，只要帮助消化难消化食物就可以了）\n抗生素疗程结束后需要重建菌群的情况下建议使用复合益生菌或同种健康龟大便\n\n3.甲硝唑\n\n\n用途：杀原虫药、消炎药\n用量：一次性用量50mg/kg；重复用量25mg/kg五至七日\n禁忌：益生菌不可同用（丁酸梭菌、布拉迪除外）\n备注：具有神经毒素\n\n甲硝唑似乎是目前半水流行必备药物，且许多龟友选择泡药途径（醒醒，泡药等于放弃浓度控制），因为它基本上可以解决各种原虫备受推崇。啥绿便啊果冻便啊大家第一反应就是甲硝唑。\n不过，甲硝唑在解决原虫同时，对于肠道益生菌是毁灭性打击，空肠综合症带来的副作用反而被当作疾病治疗也不罕见。那么，谨慎使用甲硝唑，最好结合显微镜便检再确定用药。\n4.阿苯达唑\n\n\n用途：内寄杀虫\n用量：一次性用量50mg/kg；若持续排出虫体或虫卵则14天后重复给药\n\n阿苯达唑也是养半水玩家不陌生的一类药物。比如排便观察到活虫、进食排泄正常但是头肌萎缩消瘦等情况下都要考虑内寄影响。\n特别要注意的是，假设药量不足，会对寄生虫产生激惹反应，在消化道内乱钻乱咬，会产生更严重的后果。（所以真的别拿这个药去泡龟，按剂量吃！）\n5.显微镜\n说到显微镜，龟友们可能下意识反应是小题大做。实际上，显微镜不仅有效，且便宜。\n\n如果仅用于看龟粪便原虫的话，一两百的预算就足够了。（甚至几十）\n遇到不明粪便，放到显微镜底下看看是咋回事，心里都会安心十分。\n值得一提的是，显微镜下常见的纤毛虫、毛滴虫都是正常龟肠道微生物的一部分。假设镜检发现数量较为稀少，是无需采取任何措施的。正常情况下，原虫可以辅助肠道蠕动、营养吸收。仅在龟出现免疫抑制情况时原虫大量繁殖才会变成病原体。\n6.洗必泰&amp;F10软膏\n\n\n用途：腐甲、外伤等\n用法：先用洗必泰冲洗/清洁伤口后用F10软膏覆盖\n替代品：聚维酮碘、红霉素软膏等\n\n个人处理外伤及腐甲惯用药。\n7.鞣酸软膏\n\n\n用途：甲壳真菌\n用法：抹就完事了\n\n8.水飞蓟\n\n\n用途：护肝\n用法：生病用药时配合使用\n用量：15mg/kg\n\n\n日常常备药品基本就是上面这几类了，存在各类别内许多可以相互替代的。\nRefeeding Syndrome复食综合症\n复食综合症是长期拒食突然摄入食物（快速摄入卡路里，尤其是碳水化合物）后的电解质失衡如低磷血症和低钾血症，钾及磷水平急速下降，这些电解质失衡会导致溶血性贫血或心律失常以及猝死。\n此种症状在爬行动物中未得到彻底研究，但在人类身上会引起肌肉无力、手足抽搐、癫痫、心肌障碍、溶血性贫血、体液滞留及死亡。\n\n这种症状在半水龟饲养中并不罕见。\n最常见表现是，新龟到家头几天就开始喂食，龟吃的挺好的，然后过了一段时间突然拒食、趴窝、萎靡不振、闭眼嗜睡，严重者很快死亡。\n其实就是刚到家/出眠阶段补液没有做好，电解质仍然处于紊乱状态的龟没办法完成食物的消化，电解质还会进一步失衡。\n\n应对方法：\n\n以预防为主，观察龟脱水程度，有脱水迹象的龟禁止喂食；\n进行补液管理（见今天头一条）；\n补液完成后的营养支持应从小份量开始（头2-4次喂食控制在所需能量的50%以下，在后续2-4天中逐步增加份量）；\n补液完成后仍虚弱拒食个体进行营养支持，灌食等渗营养粉直至自主进食。\n\n","id":"https://wendajiang.github.io/turtle/chang-yong-yao/","title":"常用药"},"https://wendajiang.github.io/turtle/hy-turtle/":{"body":"大别山黄缘龟形态分析\n龟鳖养殖销售证明办理\n黄缘龟，古代文人雅士深爱的风水宠物。好养耐看、聪明、互动好，能把大人小孩都逗乐的小龟龟。黄缘龟壳像红木紫檀的颜色：深棕且黑里透红，侧面是黄色，龟甲纹路细密，像雕刻的工艺品；极具中国特色美，美丽而内敛，贵气却不娇贵，是一种很受欢迎的名贵风水龟。\n\n一个表格•教你区分南、北种黄缘\n以地区划分，黄缘有南缘和北缘之分，安徽黄缘和湖北黄缘这两种地处北方的黄缘统称为北缘，台湾黄缘则为南缘。南缘和北缘的主要特征有以下区别：\n\n\n黄缘龟好看、又萌萌哒、还会与人互动，自从人工繁殖成功后，现在已经越来越多的家庭饲养为宠物龟。本文从以下六个方面为您全面介绍这个正在流行的“新秀名宠”：\n一、黄缘龟简介\n黄缘龟，属于半水栖性龟(偏陆栖)，在自然界中，黄缘盒龟栖息于丘陵山区的林缘、杂草、灌木之中，在树根底下、石缝等比较安静的地方。黄缘盒龟属山龟，不能生活在深水域内。\n\n黄缘龟是一种很易驯化和饲养的龟，它们不怕生，生命力顽强。杂食性，雌龟个体重约450克左右时性成熟。同年龄的龟，雌性个体总是大于雄性个体。雌性个体重可达1000克以上，雄性个体重很少超过500克。黄缘盒龟较其他的淡水龟类胆大，不畏惧人，同类很少争斗。饲养2～4月的个体，在食物的引逗下可随主人爬动。\n\n黄缘的雌龟个体总是会大于同龄的雄龟个体，黄缘盒龟的性成熟期一般为5年，而且必须5年里每年都进行冬眠，因为只有冬眠才会促进黄缘的性腺发育，而非某些资料里说的雄龟个体重280g，雌龟个体重450g左右性成熟。如果从不进行冬眠那么无论黄缘长到多大的个体，它始终不会有生殖繁育的能力，这是至关重的。\n雄龟背甲长而稍扁，尾较粗长；雌龟背甲厚，尾较短。\n（1）雄性黄缘盒龟的背部拱起较高，顶部尖，腹甲后缘略尖，尾长，泄殖腔孔距尾基部较远；雌性龟的背部拱起较小，但顶部钝，腹甲后缘略呈半圆形，尾粗短，泄殖腔孔距尾基部较近。\n\n（2）将龟的腹部朝天，用手将龟的四肢、头顶触缩人壳内，将龟的尾部摆直，若是雄性龟，则可看到交接器从泄殖腔孔内翻出，呈黑色伞状。而雌性的泄殖腔孔内仅排出泡泡或稀粘液。\n二、黄缘龟的分类\n学术分类：\n黄缘闭壳龟，国家二级保护动物，属于淡水龟科、盒龟属。亚种分为南中国种群(C.

；日本。\n民间分类：\n由于环境气候的不同，龟的表现也会不同，市场也分为四种：安缘、大陆缘、台缘、杂交缘（最近几年才出现的杂交，主要是拿贵价钱的安缘公和价钱便宜的台缘母杂交，生出来品相好的按安缘卖、品相差的按大陆缘卖。所以买安缘一定要找有诚信的繁殖场）\n\n目前学术界还没有将它们进行“亚种级”区分（个人认为是早晚之事）。不同产地的黄缘，在品相上小有区别，各具特色，但外观大致相同，而且都是很聪明漂亮和生命力顽强的龟种，因此不必刻意去搞“种族歧视”，可以根据个人喜好和经济条件放心选择。\n三、黄缘的优点及其鉴别\n首先，我们总结了“黄缘盒龟”具有如下八大优点，因此可称得上是宠物龟中的明星，这也是它一直颇受养龟爱好者的青睐的原因：\n\n1、最大的特点是聪明、活泼、胆大、易驯熟、亲近人，此龟和饲主有良好的互动性\n2、其次是漂亮，不但有鲜艳明朗的头部、古典雅致的背部、平整舒圆的腹部，还有灵气十足的眼神，温存甜美的表情；\n3、第三是易饲养、成活率高，此龟疾病少、体质强、易开食、食性杂、食谱广、适度耐热、高度耐寒，可冬眠、也可不冬眠（如不做繁殖使用）；\n4、第四是身体结构特殊，可以通过完全闭合腹甲来御敌，不露半点皮肉，闭壳后身体象个密封的盒子，故得“盒龟”学名，既有观赏价值、又有科普意义，让爱好者回味无穷；\n5、第五是因野生种群数量日益减少，人工繁殖产量不高，因此若得一只佳品则很具有收藏价值\n6、第六是具有较长的寿命，人工饲养状态下陪您半个世纪应该没有问题。因其聪明胆大，所以饲养时间越长，与主人的感情越深，越具灵性，饲养得当或许能够成为陪伴饲主一生的好伴侣。而其忍饥耐渴、抵御恶劣环境的能力远非猫狗鱼鸟之类所能。\n7、黄缘隶属半水栖龟类，兼有水龟与陆龟的双重特性，而且与其它半水栖龟相比，黄缘的陆栖倾向更强，这也是一个很好的特性，因为干养和浅水养均可，如果选择干养（需定期泡澡）可以减少腐甲病的发生，省去了一些麻烦\n8、最后一点是价格适中且性价比高。既不象十几、几十元的品种那么低廉、易被放弃，又不象上万元的品种那样昂贵。从其品貌性状横向比较而言的确物有所值。\n\n世上有如此美妙好龟，问君欲养“黄缘盒”否？\n其实，答案不言而喻，喜欢此龟的人一定不少！很多朋友都想获得一只品相上成、货真价实的好黄缘，那么我们该如何评定和选择一只高品质的黄缘盒龟呢？在此，我仅以个人观点归纳一些日常在选购和评价黄缘方面的方法，提供给大家做参考，如有不当之处，还望朋友们多多批评指正。\n1、就不同产地的品相来看，个人认为总体上是安徽黄缘最美观，这些优势主要表现在外形、颜色、甲壳纹路等。\n\n2、就同一产地相同亚种的成体黄缘来说（暂时抛开外伤不谈，这些主要指甲壳撞划痕、趾甲缺失、肢体及皮肤损伤等），野生的要优于人工繁殖的。\n3、如何评价一只黄缘属于何种品位、层次，我个人认为有以下几个参考指标：\n（1）体格强壮，身体各器官功能健全，视、听、嗅觉敏锐，饮食、排泄正常，腹甲开、闭自如，能用四肢称起身体快速行走，身体各个部位均无残缺（包括肢体、头、尾、龟甲、皮肤、趾甲等均无缺失或伤痕）。\n（2）品相端正、外观漂亮、耐看，这方面的要素主要包括：背甲为规整的椭圆型，前部略窄、后部稍宽，隆起较高，脊棱明显，中脊线较黄且贯通，背甲为深棕色且黑里透红、表面有光泽，腹甲为黑色、边缘清晰，背甲和腹甲均有清晰、细密、规整的同心年纹，缘盾为整齐、光洁的淡黄色；头大、头顶平滑橄榄色，头后的U型饰纹清晰、颜色鲜黄，安徽种一般因镶有细细的黑边而更加明显，鼓膜清晰，脸颊部和脖子泛出漂亮的橘红色；眼睛大小适中，炯炯有神，充满灵性；四肢外侧淡灰黑色，上覆鳞片整齐、光洁，内面及掌心泛出肉白色；趾（指）甲齐全、灰黑色，趾间具半蹼；尾长短适中，尖端无缺残，淡黄色夹杂灰色线条。\n\n（3）聪明胆大、性情活泼，爱活动，不怕人，与饲主有良好的互动性。\n（4）非发情期雄龟不乱抓乱咬同类或其它一同饲养的龟（这条也可以不作参考）。\n如果您的黄缘具能够满足上述第一条特点，可以算是“全品”，如果具备上述前两条特点，可评为“上品”，如果具备上述前三条优点，应当称得上是“精品”，如果能够具备上述全部四条优点，则应应该赞为“极品\n各位养黄缘的朋友看一看你们的爱龟已经达到了哪一个层次？\n4、既然多数朋友都认为安徽黄缘比台湾等其它产地的黄缘更漂亮一些，那么我们该如何区别安徽种与台湾种呢，个人认为应从以下几个方面来鉴别（可能总结的不够全面或有待进一步探讨）：\n（１）看体形。安徽背甲高，脊棱突出，从上面俯视，身型为前端稍窄的紧凑椭圆形、很舒服；台湾背甲较平，脊棱不明显，身型较长，看起来不如安徽紧凑、舒服。\n（２）看纹路。一般来讲安徽黄缘背甲、腹甲纹路都很清晰，而且排列齐密，一层层罗列上去，象雕刻的工艺品，野生的更是如此；台湾的纹路较浅，不够鲜明，而且排列较宽，腹甲基本看不出纹路，是平平的一块黑板。\n（３）看甲壳颜色，安徽较深，棕褐透暗红；台湾较浅，棕偏黄。\n（４）看颊和脖子的颜色。安徽该部位较艳丽，发橘红色；台湾较暗，偏黄色。\n（５）看头型。安徽较饱满，侧脸看胖乎乎，很可爱；台湾种属于较瘦型的头脸。\n（６）看头侧黄线，安徽的黄线条明显且宽、多有清晰的黑边；个别台湾产个体无黑边缀饰。\n（7）看上喙外观，安徽上喙略带鹰钩，台湾乃至大陆其他产地的黄缘上喙平切、一般无此特征。\n\n四、饲养方法\n（由于篇幅原因，本篇只讲家庭散养方法。）黄缘龟是森林附近水边栖息的陆生龟，特点是需要有水，但不能长时间泡水里；喜欢阴凉的地方、但又要每天有太阳晒到。家养最简单的方法是放家里任其爬行，饿的时候龟会自己出来找吃的（刚开始要抓出来喂几次，慢慢就学会了）。但要记得长备一个水盘在龟经常休息的地方。\n\n\n也可以用小型的栅栏给龟龟专门围出一个小地方，如果是放阳台或窗台还需要有一块地方是遮阳的，避免太阳曝晒整个小龟园~~\n当然，小的时候还是要用整理箱或玻璃缸养到龟龟有烟盒那么大再散养，龟太小满屋跑容易找不到，也容易缺水：\n\n\n根据多年的饲养经验发现，黄缘排泄物气味大小与其所进食的食物种类密切相关。总体来说是食素气味小，食荤气味大。我曾做过这样实验，将所养黄缘分为两组，第一组的食谱是（龟粮、香蕉、番茄、加少量虫类），第二组的食谱是（牛肉、鲜虾、虫类），这样连续喂养大约1个月后，第一组排泄物的气味变得微弱，与花龟、草龟等排泄物异味较小的龟类基本没有差别，而第二组排泄物气味则一直较强。\n\n此外，龟的排泄物遗留在陆地还是水中对周围空气的影响程度差别明显。排泄在水中能够在一段时间内有效隔离气味发散。因此给龟经常休息的旁边备一个1-2厘米水深的喂水盘很有必要，定期清理并更换新水也是克服气味问题的有效方法。目前我所饲养的黄缘均已养成了以进食营养均衡的优质龟粮为主的好习惯，只是偶尔才搭配一点水果和皮虫。每1-2天抓一把干粮投入盛有浅水的喂食盘中，几分钟便抢食物一空。\n\n多年来全部黄缘一直健康成长并保持着优美体形。因此，我不但省去了每日切肉、洗虾、养虫等烦琐之事，而且有效克服了气味问题，人龟同处一寓，始终维续着环境清雅、其乐融融的局面。。。\n\n\n我们不得不承认，养龟本身亦蕴涵着文化。本人养龟多年，藏龟多种，尤对黄缘这种靓丽、强壮、聪明且颇具人性化的龟种有着特殊的情素。\n五、黄缘龟苗的挑选方法\n黄缘的价格也是一路上涨，越来越多的养龟新手，开始饲养或投资，以目前的市场，安缘价格远高于台缘，为了让玩家能够明确分辨黄缘的种类，不让无良商家欺骗，咱今天就说说安缘苗与台缘苗的区别。\n刚刚出壳不久的大陆缘苗与台缘苗是非常好辨认的，非常明显的区别有两点，一是在于颈盾上面的2块背甲；二是背甲金线末尾处。咱先来说颈盾，如下图：\n\n大部分台湾黄缘苗颈盾画圈处，有2个浅色的小甲块。不少JS会忽悠人说：“看，这大陆缘还是轻微变异的！”往后要遇到这情况请掉头就走，竖不竖中指随你了。大陆缘的颈盾则不会有两块浅色甲片，如下图：纯安缘\n\n第二个明显的差异：是背甲金线末尾处。台湾黄缘金线末尾处是一个圆点收尾，忽然增大的圆点。\n\n大陆黄缘整条线都是差不多粗细的，金线末尾处不会有圆点。\n根据以上两点区别，就可以很轻松的区别出刚刚出壳的黄缘苗是台还是安。为了更好的巩固一下刚才的两点，再放上多只台缘和多只大陆缘的集体照片，让大家区别比较一下：\n\n不过养大一点，估计饲养个把月后，台湾黄缘苗的颈盾上两块浅颜色的小甲片颜色会慢慢变得和其他甲片一样。那这个时候咋区别捏？除了上述第二点金线末尾判断以外，还有两点：一是头部U线的颜色和形状；二是脖子皮肤与颈部皮肤颜色的区别。\"缘龟正传\"v号：makun44006279，欢迎来撩，只聊缘龟不撩妹^_^。\n\n左边台湾黄缘苗头部的U线是淡黄色或者黄白色，并且形状是两个对称三角形，从粗到细慢慢过渡。右边大陆黄缘苗头上的U线却不一样，颜色是橘黄色，U线底部和台湾黄缘苗一样粗，但是到了中部，忽然一下子就变细了，一直到眼角为此都一样细的。大伙多看看比较对比一下就一目了然了。\n\n第二就是脖子皮肤与颈部皮肤颜色的区别，先不说啥，发三张图上来大伙比较比较再说哈！\n\n\n\n看出来没？大陆黄缘苗的脖子白净的淡色，台湾黄缘苗的脖子是深色的。还有腿，大陆的是灰色带点红色，台湾的是全黑。以上是最明显的区别特征，当然还有更多的区别，只是不能很明显的区别，因为有个体差异。比如说侧脸：\n\n大陆缘侧脸是橘红色，特别是眼角处的侧脸部最红，有的越往脖子处越淡，有的一直红到脖子处。\n\n台湾黄缘苗侧脸颜色则是黄白色，淡淡的柠檬黄。\n如下图（请忽略它饥渴的吃相）前腿侧面的红线，只有大陆黄缘有，而台湾黄缘从来无见过有这条腿线。\n\n即使是纯安苗子生下来的时候脖子也不可能每只都是干净无杂色的，黄缘苗时候是不易区分安台杂的，而且安缘台缘杂缘都是黄缘，从生命的本质上没有高低贵贱之分，价格的高低也是人们根据市场需求和个人喜好给它定的标签，此文作为一篇学术性文章，并没有贬低台缘体貌特征的用意，我们也不应该加入人为的喜好去批判。\n黄缘闭壳龟健康活泼、非常有灵性，是一种与主人互动超强的宠物龟，且它的寿命很长，养好了传个两三辈儿没有问题。\n六、安缘、台缘、大陆缘和杂交黄缘龟的区别\n大陆缘”是泛指中国大陆种的黄缘（包括安缘），湖北、湖南、浙江等省的黄缘本文称为“非安大陆缘”。\n黄 缘的背甲的形态、颜色都会随生长环境的改变而改变。但与遗传（种属）相关的皮肤的颜色、瞳孔、嘴部外观就比较稳定，就像人有高矮、胖瘦、美丑，但人种特征 基本不变的也是以上这些一样。所以区分黄缘的种属（大陆、台），主要看颈部、四肢皮肤颜色、瞳孔、喙尖突起的程度和四肢皮肤的颜色。在这步鉴定中，不用看 背甲，看背甲反而会干扰我们做出正确的判断。一般大陆的颈部为淡红黄色，瞳孔一字线不明显，喙突明显，四肢呈淡红褐色，与腹侧的黄色过度自然，没有黑、黄 分明的感觉，台缘则相反。这样鉴别出来的台缘，无论背甲多高、纹路多细、背线多连贯，都改变不了台的血统。\n安和台的区别：\n脖子：台缘的脖子发黑，偏棕色，颜色很暗；安缘的脖子是橘红色的，颜色也很淡。安缘的极品种脖子是肉红色的，很漂亮很自然的粉红色。如果看到是粉红色的喉咙那肯定是安缘了，但这样的安缘价格很高。\n\n2、四肢颜色的区别（如下图）\n\n大陆缘前臂鳞片为红褐色，逐渐变成肉红色和颈部相连，过渡非常柔和。\n3、喙的区别：大陆缘有像鹰嘴一样向突起的喙尖，安缘的最明显，称为鹰钩嘴，台缘的喙尖几乎没有；\n\n4、眼线的区别：大陆缘的眼线比较淡，呈“一”字型，安缘的眼线几乎没有，台缘则有很浓的椭圆形型眼线，以下用典型的图示来说明其眼线的区别\n\n\n头部：台缘的头部U线后部通常较粗，并且U线不够细腻。台缘头部黄色花纹呈浅黄色，且与整个头部颜色对比鲜明；安缘头部黄色花纹偏橘黄色，发红，整个头部 颜色对比不强烈。台缘的脸色发青发绿，铁青着一张脸像刚和谁吵过架似的，安缘的脸色较为红润，给人一种更为善意的感觉。\n\n\n6.背线的区别：大陆种（包括安缘）的背线普遍较为连贯，中间不断线。台种和日本种的背线普遍为不连贯。\n\n7.U线的区别：大陆缘U线大多数相连，台缘U线不连。大陆缘U线颜色偏浅黄，安缘偏橘黄，台缘颜色偏鲜黄。\n\n8 杂交黄缘龟\n杂交的缘（近几年才有的杂交苗）杂合了两者的特点，它不等同于非安大陆缘，而是基因比较混乱的人工产物，个人认为杂交缘的观赏性比纯的台缘更低。杂交缘均为低背，主要鉴别是颈部偏暗，头部黄色与颈部的深色过度不自然，且色彩分布不均匀，有明显的缺色、杂色，瞳孔散大，边际不清，有的甚至全黑，喙的特征也不明显。\n\n安与台杂交的缘则呈现出脸红脖子黑的特征，下颌和脖子交接的地方颜色分界线非常明显，黑眼珠也很大。但安缘和非安大陆缘杂交的缘由于仍属于大陆种，一 脉相承，品相介于安缘和非安大陆之间。而实际上现在很多不是很典型的“安缘”，多为和大陆缘杂交的产物。这里就不展开讨论了。\n生长环境、营养等原因对背甲的影响很大，区分大陆和台缘不必看背甲的高低和纹路，台缘也可以有高背细纹。（如下图就是一只很极品的台缘）\n\n安和非安大陆缘的区别\n区 分好大陆缘和台缘、杂交缘后，可进一步细分安缘和其他地方的大陆缘（非安）。安徽缘是大陆缘的模式种，所以大陆缘所具有的特点表现在安缘上更加明显。如皮 肤颜色更加鲜艳、眼线极淡、喙突（鹰嘴）更加明显，且野生安缘分布于高海拔的大别山（最高1774米），所以整体高背，湖北、浙江丘陵地区海拔较低，所以 多为低背。又因为海拔高、温度低、生长缓慢，所以背甲上纹路清晰、细腻、平整。还有就是野.生安缘生长于高海拔的山区，经常要攀爬，所以普遍比较强壮，表 现在四肢和颈比较粗壮、有力。如果把大陆缘和台缘的区别比喻成黄种人和黑种人的区别的话，那么安缘和其他大陆缘的区别可以比喻成中国北方人和南方人的区 别。前一个是种属上的区别，后一个是品相、体格上的区别（血统是一样的）。\n非安大陆缘与安缘主要区别在脸上：安徽脸颊和颈脖较艳丽红，发橘红色；非安大陆缘则较平淡，呈橘黄色；安缘有明显的鹰钩嘴，非安大陆缘喙突较小；安缘几乎没有眼线，呈“圆瞳”，大陆缘有淡淡的眼线；大陆缘大多数U线基本相连，安缘U线完全相连。安缘典型的红脸、红颈。\n\n安缘典型的鹰钩嘴，由于年龄的原因喙尖稍有磨损，但可以看出其基底部很大，甚至向前方隆起。左边的安缘嘴型就很经典。\n\n安缘典型的无眼线（圆瞳），也叫杏仁眼，但也有少数安缘有淡淡的眼线的。\n\n非安大陆缘则以上特征减弱，脸偏橘黄，颈部土黄色，整体还是暖色的。\n\n非安大陆缘喙尖比较钝。\n\n非安大陆缘瞳孔还是很圆的，眼线平直，如“一”字穿过瞳孔。\n\n再回过头来看看台缘，差别就更大了，脸蜡黄，没有血色的感觉，特别是颈部和四肢的颜色晦暗、喙尖几乎没有突起，眼线宽大，和瞳孔一起形成椭圆形，就像墨水泼出来一样。\n\n在这步鉴定中，需要参考背甲。背甲上：非安大陆缘普遍扁平背，这个差别比较明显的，而且粗纹（水波纹）。\n\n而安缘普遍高背、细纹（刀刻纹），颈和四肢粗壮。但人工环境下的安缘背甲会比野生稍逊。\n\n非安大陆缘大多数背线较细，大部分不连续，颈和四肢较细。\n\n安缘大多数（皖北、皖南）背线连贯且粗，少数（皖西）可以不连贯。\n\n对于安缘进一步细分为皖北、皖西、皖南。皖北黄缘背较高，壳色深，红斑小，金线细，纹路细；皖西黄缘背也较高，金线较粗，但是多不连，壳色棕红，公龟多强壮型；皖南黄缘背中等，龟壳色较鲜艳，较红，体型较为圆润。\n皖北高背、线连、色深。\n\n皖西高背、线不连、色浅。\n\n皖南中背、线连、色浅（编者按：此缘是否安缘值得斟酌）\n\n","id":"https://wendajiang.github.io/turtle/hy-turtle/","title":"hy_turtle"},"https://wendajiang.github.io/turtle/lq/":{"body":"琉球黄缘（上篇）：掀起你的盖头来\n琉 球 黄 缘\n黄缘三大亚种之中，琉球种在国内是最少见到，同时也是资料最缺乏的黄缘品种。在安缘、大陆缘、台缘混乱的鉴别与纠结中，我们不妨跳将出来，欣赏一下琉球黄缘这种养在深闺人未识的美丽龟种。\n\n初 见\n琉球黄缘给我的直观感觉，首先是相对小巧的体型和鲜明的三脊棱。体型大小方面如果没有饲养过其它种黄缘，可能还没有明显的感觉，但是背甲的三脊棱，无疑会给近距离看过琉球黄缘的人留下最深刻的印象。\n具有三脊棱特征的龟品种有很多，比如直接以这个为名的三龙骨龟，又比如我们最熟悉的中华草龟，花龟，都有突起的鲜明的三脊棱特征。然而琉球黄缘的三脊棱在结构上并不明显的凸起，而仅仅是一个大钝角，但是为什么如此平缓的结构却有鲜明的脊棱特征呢，效果在于有脊棱的位置都伴有朱红的晕染颜色，结构与色彩相得益彰，红黑的强烈对比构成了水墨重彩画的韵味。\n\n即便是新出生的龟苗，也具有显著的三脊棱特征，这个特征让琉球黄缘苗和其他种黄缘苗区别明显，一眼便可区分。\n\n上图两只都是破壳不久的黄缘苗，左边为典型安徽黄缘苗，颜色暗红，色调稳重；右边为纯种琉球黄黄缘苗，可以看出已经具有鲜明的棱突特征，两侧具有突起并伴有朱红色泽。具体的三亚种对比鉴别，我积极准备资料，将在中篇里详细阐述。\n特 别\n伴随着棱突的红斑是琉球黄缘的一大特色，尽管我们在一些安徽黄缘个体上面有类似的特征（业界谓之：铜皮），在台缘的一些个体上也有类似的红斑，但是综合起来都没有琉球黄缘的这个特征具有一定的普遍性。\n琉球黄缘的红斑有一定的基因因素，不同个体的红斑大小也有明显的差异，后代的苗子也有颜色上的差异；同时也有年龄的关系，和其他种黄缘一样，年级越大背壳越发光润，红斑会显得更大更鲜明。亦可能和产地的岛屿自然隔离有关，不同岛屿的个体有一定的差异性。观赏角度来说，个人会觉得红斑大的更漂亮。\n\n细 节\n\n琉球黄缘的背甲纹路虽然没有安缘那么绵密，但是依然可以算的上精致。纹路和气候有关，和生长速度有关，琉球产地为亚热带海洋性气候地区，算上栖息地岛屿的海拔，平均温度也会比安徽等内地的年均温要高一些。所以我们不能用一个族群的特征去衡量另一个族群，好比同为蒙古人种，东亚人和南亚人的外貌都有不同的鲜明特点。\n\n琉球黄缘的腹甲颜色通常是深浅不等或不均匀的黑褐色，有些个体腹甲呈现不规则的花斑图案。年轻个体通常有清晰的生长纹路，年龄增长，纹路会随之磨损模糊。\n\n\n\n琉球黄缘苗的腹部腋盾上，往往有两个或四个对称的黑点，这些黑点甚至可以一直存在到成体。但是也有一些琉球黄缘苗子是没有这些黑点的。可见小黑点是琉球黄缘的一个有趣的特点，但并不能以此作为唯一标准判断纯种与否。\n\n生 境\n\n琉球黄缘的饲养环境和其他种黄缘以及多数半水龟没有大的差别，总的来说，需要较高而且较稳定的环境湿度，足够大的平面活动空间，必要的植被、合适的日照以及遮阴替代品，干净的水源以及能够藏匿的遮蔽处。以下就一些随拍的龟在合适的环境里的照片来展现琉球黄缘与其生活环境的和谐画面。\n\n\n\n琉球黄缘喜欢透过树荫的斑驳阳光，喜欢雨后积水的泥潭，喜欢蜗牛蛞蝓游历的苔藓，喜欢透出腐熟气息的枯木，喜欢夏季遮天蔽日的阔叶，喜欢秋季缤纷厚实的，具体到人工饲育环境下如何科学的设置环境，将在琉球黄缘（中篇）里，详细阐述。\n\n个 体\n\n看完上面一组成体琉球黄缘图片，可能很多人觉得琉球黄缘的背不高，没有安徽黄缘的高耸体型。我一直的观点是不同的龟不能互相套用评价体系，不同族群也不能用相同标准衡量。即便是按思维惯性，琉球黄缘也有高背的个体，这只小亚成琉球黄缘，即使人工饲养多年，依然保持很饱满的体型。\n\n\n\n宝 宝\n\n琉球黄缘的苗子具有鲜明的外观辨识度，鲜艳的棱突是它最大的亮点。\n\n\n缘苗背甲的颜色以暗红为基调，搭配棱凸的朱红，背脊的亮黄色，协调配色的格调上有对比、有反差，总体感觉沉稳，局部却张扬个性。\n\n\n现在很多玩家挑选黄缘苗尤其是安缘苗，都讲究头线连背线连（所谓“双连”），甚至以此作为判断亚种和是否纯种的依据，个人觉得实在是以偏概全。这个双连的标准从何而来？发明这个标准的人又见过多少个体，做过多少统计数据。安缘里也有很多头线不连的，之所以这个标准会流行，恰恰因为头线连的相对少，物以稀为贵，少的就可以提高个体价格，就有更大的利益。就像男性审美占高地的人类社会里，过去讲究评价美女的标准之一是“樱桃小口”，美女嘴巴小的吃面条只能唆，还不能吃杂酱面，要不然一唆面条，酱全糊脸上了；现代社会讲求个性解放，大嘴美女又流行了，烈焰红唇，又嘟又翘，一管唇膏从左涂到右边就该买新的了。闹半天就我们这些嘴巴不大不小的横竖占不到美的边咯？说白了都是制造了概念又成功的植入了概念，即便荒谬，也既成事实。\n\n那么我们以琉球缘苗为例子看看头线如何吧：其实以我有限的繁殖经验来看，琉球缘苗的头色和头线非常多变，有暖色调偏黄的，有冷色调发青的，有头线连的，有头线末端变大斑块的，有镶边对比明显的，有模糊淡雅的…相对来说比安缘的头色头线类型更加复杂多变。个人觉得和种群的生活环境造成的基因类型有关，海岛型的生物比大陆型的生物往往自然隔离现象更加严重。安缘和湖北缘、浙江缘有差异，虽然地缘相连；大陆缘和台缘有差异，因为隔着海峡且气候迥异。而琉球黄缘，生活在群岛地区且分布在几个岛屿上，自然的区隔更加的碎片化，这也恰好促成了琉球黄缘的形态的多变性。\n\n\n\n\n无论是哪一种类型，自然选择的搭配都是美的。琉球黄缘的美还处在璞玉阶段，还没有被国内的无序繁殖污染，至少你还不用在欣赏琉球黄缘的美的同时脑袋里穿插进入如何分辨纯种的杂念。\n\n让我们珍惜这美丽的物种吧！安静的欣赏，是一件最纯洁的事情。\n琉球黄缘（中篇）：我们不一样！\n\n\n我们不一样\n本期主要说点琉球黄缘的饲养环境以及和其他亚种的对比。上篇已经就琉球黄缘的特征做了表述，简单来说最有代表性的就是明显的三龙骨和脊棱上的红晕。\n\n典型的大红斑块，为了直观的区分，我将不同亚种的缘放在一起拍照对比解说。先来和安缘的对比图：\n琉球黄缘 &amp; 安缘\n\n安缘和琉球缘对比图（左一为安缘)\n上图左1为安缘，其他两只为不同风格的琉球黄缘。可以看出安缘背线较为连贯，背甲呈现深檀红色，色调沉着，壳型高耸圆润。中间的一只琉球缘非常显眼，具有典型的三棱脊结构，红晕大，与黑色的底色对比明显，显得格外鲜艳。背线断续不连，由于年纪较大，壳的纹路较为模糊。右边是一只较年轻的龟，一样具有三棱脊结构，背线断续，红晕相对较小，颜色偏深，但是依然对比度高。安缘和琉球缘的区别比较明显，基本不存在混淆的可能。\n\n琉球缘苗和安缘苗的对比：琉球缘苗和安缘苗的区别也非常明显，一眼就可以看出区别。琉球缘苗从出生就有明显的三棱背和伴随脊棱的红晕，红黑对比明显；安缘苗是比较均匀的檀红壳色。\n\n琉球缘苗和安缘苗的背甲区别：\n上图红色箭头标出3个明显的区别：1、琉球缘颈盾两边的缘盾有明显的红晕；2、两侧棱突出，伴随着明显的红晕；3、靠尾部的椎盾上，背线的末端界限模糊，呈现晕开状。而安缘则普遍没有这些特征，壳色均匀，背线清晰。\n\n琉球缘苗和安缘苗的头颈区别：\n琉球缘苗头颈部和安缘也有一定的区别：上图红箭头指示处，琉球缘的头线通常波折较多，转折处比较宽，部分群体头线有中断；脖子颜色多数较深。而安缘苗头线相对较细较连贯，脖子颜色棕色，过渡较自然。\n\n琉球缘有非常多变的头线：\n琉球缘的头线有很多的变化，最常见的是类似耐克标志的对勾型，而且黄斑面积较大，非常醒目。当然琉球缘也有部分个体具有和安缘类似的U型头线。常常有龟友评判琉球缘品相也用“双线连”的标准来衡量，黄缘作为一个原生物种，自然才是造就它们不同样子的魔法师，人类没有资格设定标准评价它们的美丑。当然人有自己的审美倾向，所谓“双线连”可以作为人工饲养条件下定向培育的一种标准。但是用安缘的某些特征去套其他种群的个体也不合适。琉球缘有着非常多变的头线花纹，这正是它非常独特的地方，也是它作为一个稀少种群的魅力所在。至于背线连，事实上大多数琉球缘成年后，背线都是断续的，因此追求苗子的背线连更是没有多少意义。\n琉球黄缘 &amp; 台缘\n琉球缘和安缘的区别明显，而与台缘却有很多的相似，很容易混淆。甚至有些人对基础的分类知识不了解，就简单粗暴的认为琉球缘是杂交台缘。下面我就实例对比一下琉球缘和台缘的一些异同点。\n\n左琉球缘，右台缘，均为雄性\n上图以成年的雄性琉球缘和雄性台缘作为对比案例。可以看出，首先体型差异很明显，琉球缘的个体明显小于台缘。（当然也可能因为挑选的个体差异，造成这种明显差异。）琉球缘在三大黄缘亚种里的确是平均体型最小的一种。其次，琉球缘成体的三棱脊特征依然非常明显，背线断续，脊棱伴生鲜明的红晕；而台缘背线也断续，貌似也有两条侧棱，但是显然侧棱视觉上比较黯淡，并不能给人三棱背的感觉。\n\n琉球缘与台缘的头线对比：\n上图可以看出两只龟都是健壮成熟的公龟，头部肌肉都很发达，尤其是台缘，头部更显得壮硕。重要的是看头线的颜色，同样是黄色的头线，台缘的黄色偏冷，琉球的黄色相对偏暖一点。学过画画的可能更有感觉，台缘的黄色更像是颜料里的柠檬黄，琉球缘的黄更像是中黄或淡黄，而安缘的黄是中黄到橙黄。当然颜色也和饲养的环境和龟的状态有关，良好的室外环境下，色素更沉着，龟的颜色会更为鲜明。\n\n琉球缘与台缘的侧脸对比：\n琉球缘和台缘的侧脸对比，依然和色调有关系。台缘的脸颊颜色和头线颜色统一为偏冷的色调，脸型相对比较圆润，比如喙的角度，头部的长宽比例等等，整体显得柔和敦厚；琉球缘的脸颊颜色相对偏暖，头型相对偏长，显得较为干练精壮。\n\n琉球缘与台缘的脖子对比：\n琉球缘的脖子有一个比较突出的共性特征，那就是脖子下方有比较清晰的花斑。请注意上图的箭头处，琉球缘的脖子下面有网状的黑线和斑点，而台缘的脖子相对比较干净。因为图片上是成年龟，而且拍摄时候，龟脖子有自然扭曲，因此花斑还不是太明显，那么我们来看下面琉球缘的亚成体和苗子的脖子实拍照片。\n\n亚成体琉球缘的脖子细节图\n注意看这只琉球缘的脖子下面，喉咙位置有明显的花斑，打个比方就像给脖子刷了一层深色颜料，结果刷到喉咙位置的时候没颜料了，就留下这么一块斑驳的区域。\n\n琉球缘苗的脖子细节图\n琉球缘苗的脖子花斑更为清晰，颜色对比也更为明显。\n\n琉球缘苗的脖子花斑\n翻过来看更加直观，不同个体的花斑形状和分布大小都有不同，当然这个特征相对隐蔽，不太容易直接观察到。其他亚种黄缘，比如台缘，有些黑脖子个体也有这样的花斑，但是区块分布有差异，没有琉球缘这么清晰显著。当然由于我本人并未繁殖台缘，没有足够多的个体做比对，不免认识偏颇，欢迎大家讨论。\n人工饲育环境\n\n琉球黄缘和其它亚种的黄缘饲养环境没有区别，适合以土基陆地为主，带有水潭，有植被树荫或遮阴替代，湿度较高的环境饲养。这里介绍一下我个人设置的琉球黄缘的饲养环境，也适用于作为大陆黄缘、北美箱龟、锯缘等龟的环境参考。\n\n琉球黄缘大部分时间都在陆地上生活，因此需要有足够的平面面积活动，和足够多的泥土和良好的通风条件来快速分解排泄物。因此室外饲养远胜于室内环境。\n\n黄缘的饲养环境我设计为几段式，分别是龟窝、产卵区、进食区、活动区、水池区。环境面积宽裕的地方，各功能区域划分较为清晰；环境紧凑的地方，龟窝和产卵区可以合并，进食区和活动区可以合并。\n\n无花果树营造半荫蔽的环境\n饲养黄缘龟，植被自然是少不了的，一来遮挡烈日形成荫蔽，二来提供稳定的环境湿度，再就是地面植被或植物落叶，可以自然形成天然的躲避区。我选择了无花果作为主要树种，因为无花果生长较为快速，叶片也较大，大大缩短了成荫的周期；另外在我这里的气候条件下，无花果到深秋季节就会落光叶子，大量的落叶为环境提供了足够的地面基材。落叶可以维持地面湿度，还可以给蚯蚓、蜗牛等生物提供生长的温床，这些小生物同时也是黄缘的食谱之一。同时熟透的无花果，甜度很高，并且具有特别的香味，也是半水龟类特别爱吃的水果之一，有很多自然熟透掉落的果子，就成为它们的开胃小食。\n\n低矮的灌木竹丛是龟最喜欢的躲避处\n除了无花果树，地面会自然长出各种杂草，我这里因为地下有竹鞭，春季还会长出很多小竹笋，最后长成灌木型的小竹子。我会刻意保留一部分小竹丛，穿插在无花果树下，形成疏密结合、高低错落的丛林景观。地面的各类杂草基本上是放任不管的，这些被鸟和风带来的种子长出来的草本植物五花八门，有蛇莓、艾蒿、车前草、蒲公英、三叶草、紫花地丁、商陆…更多的是叫不出名字的小草，偶尔还有木本植物长出来，通常是附近一些大树的种子通过风力吹来的种子掉落在地上长出幼苗，比如最常见的梧桐、香樟。这类乔木型的幼苗，我一般是要清除掉，一旦长大，会严重影响无花果树的生长。\n\n砍掉过多的小竹笋，留在原地变成腐殖质。\n在种植无花果树的头一两年，因为树苗根系还没有长大，树冠还没有形成足够的荫蔽，地面阳光充裕，杂草们会疯狂生长，尤其是艾蒿之类，可以生长到一米多高，我也基本不加管理，因为这样正好可以解决部分遮阴问题，但是毕竟草本植物高度有限，即便能遮挡阳光，但是热量会积聚在较矮的高度，夏季地面温度相对较高，湿度也更低。这段时期的夏季，我会拉上小面积的遮阳网，为龟制造阴凉。等到两三年后，无花果占据强势地位，树荫覆盖全池后，下面的杂草自然受到压制，需要强光照的品种自然淘汰，留下的基本都是荫生植物和苔藓，这样的环境和温湿度更适合琉球黄缘生活。\n\n斑驳的阳光，黄缘的最爱，树荫会营造斑驳阳光的地带，琉球黄缘特别喜欢这样的环境，既可以伪装，有安全感，有可以享受到日照，吸收热量。\n\n春季的龟需要更多日晒，在春季，树木的叶片才开始生长，地面光照强，积温较高，同时秋冬的落叶这个时候已经基本腐烂，形成松软的浅层有机质。因此一些草本植物生长旺盛，在这个季节里一样为龟提供了舒适的躲避所。\n\n春季的充足日晒有利于繁殖。选择落叶树木，一大优点就是在气温较低的春季里，树枝上没有叶片，阳光直射，地面获得更多热量，龟可以吸收到更多的太阳热能和紫外线，对繁殖产蛋非常有好处。而到了夏季，树荫成型，在高温季节提供了荫凉。\n\n临水的区域也是琉球黄缘最喜欢的活动区，琉球黄缘饲养场地的水池不可缺少，水池的位置和大小可以根据实际情况而定。总体要求是水池坡度小，进出方便，蓄水量大，排水方便，有一定的遮阴。水池周围往往是琉球黄缘最喜欢的活动区域，因此这块区域是整个场地里使用率最高的。我特别强调一个水量和水深问题，很多人觉得黄缘之类龟基本在陆地活动，只需要有浅水池喝水和泡湿身体即可，因此设计龟环境的时候只给予很小很浅的水区。这样小而浅的水区，水质非常容易变坏，需要经常的换水来维持。另外较浅的水位，在夏季容易水温过热，一来加速水质恶化，二来也不能满足龟下水降温的实际需求。事实上当你为它们提供足够大的水域和水深后，你会改变自己的想法，琉球黄缘或其他种黄缘，都非常喜欢在水里活动，特别是炎热的夏季，它们本能的会选择在较深的水里享受清凉。\n\n琉球黄缘在水底活动，水池区域必须有遮阴措施，无论是天然树荫还是人工搭建遮阳设备，遮蔽部分阳光，可以保持合适的水温，也可以一定程度上稳定水质。\n\n树荫下的水池，虽然黄缘脚蹼不发达，游泳技术并不好，但是它们其实并不容易溺水。只要提供缓坡营造深浅区域，它们会非常安全的享受这一设施。在炎热的夏季，有的琉球黄缘会静静的浮在水面上，晒着花花太阳，仿佛在做SPA；有的会潜行在水底，把自己和外界暂时隔离开来，享受一只龟的清净。\n\n\n非常享受的表情，就差头顶上搭一块白毛巾了，我甚至发现，琉球黄缘会一直潜伏在水底的落叶里休息，秋冬季节甚至直接进入冬眠状态，就像水龟一样冬眠。起初我也觉得会不会溺死，但是经过观察，它们毫无安全问题。某些个体总是喜欢选择呆在水里，既然它们喜欢，我也就不做过多的打扰。\n\n水底半冬眠状态的琉球黄缘，当然在遇到严寒结冰的情况下，我会把选择在水里冬眠的琉球黄缘捞回来，放在设置好的龟窝里继续越冬。因为本地的气候极端寒冷天气下，会结厚比砖头的冰，对于琉球黄缘这种原生在亚热带海洋性气候的龟，还是非常危险的。\n\n除了自己在龟池里栽培果树和灌木来营造环境，还有一种方法就是根据实际情况，收集大量枯叶铺垫，做成仿生的林下环境，也非常适合琉球黄缘的生活习性。当然如果旁边有现成的落叶乔木，那就连收集树叶的工作都省了。\n\n大量落叶提供了保温保湿的地面环境，落叶层覆盖住地面泥土，不仅保持了地面的水分，提供了高湿度环境，同时也可以蓄积太阳热量，形成一个温湿度相对稳定的环境。琉球黄缘非常喜欢钻入落叶层休息，或者身体埋进去，只露出脑袋四处张望。\n\n图中有几只龟露出脊背，能找的到吗？\n\n落叶是非常好的躲避所和伪装\n较厚的落叶还可以通过自然发酵产生热量，可以孕育很多的蠕虫、昆虫，以及微生物，可以快速分解食物残渣和龟的排泄物。\n\n上图基本是香樟树叶。落叶的种类选择并没有什么优劣之分，值得注意的是某些气味强烈的植物叶片不建议在室内小环境内使用。比如气味浓烈的香樟树叶，我在通风良好，光照充足的室外用毫无问题，但是在室内饲养环境下，可能会因为植物挥发油的气味，对龟造成一些影响。我使用过诸如银杏树叶、竹叶、梧桐叶、玉兰树叶等植物落叶，各有优缺点，较小较薄的叶子堆积起来更蓬松，更适合龟钻入躲藏，但是腐烂较快；大而厚的叶片维持时间很长，但是比较硬朗，作为底材很好，但是覆盖度不好，需要量比较大才能适合龟的躲藏。\n说完了龟的活动区域和水区，最后说说龟窝部分，在精简的分段式环境里，龟窝既是龟的休息躲避所，也是繁殖季节的产卵所。\n\n半封闭龟窝，龟窝的设置因地制宜，一般要求相对避光、保温、安静。我是把龟窝和龟的活动区用墙隔开，墙上开洞方便进出。龟窝内有厚度10-25厘米的土层，土上覆盖落叶或者稻草（冬眠季节会增加大量稻草起到保温作用）。落叶和稻草可以保持龟窝内的泥土湿度，因为龟窝内不会有雨水，我们还要定期喷水以维持一个最佳的湿度环境。如果是做繁殖，那么户外活动区域地面需要铺设陶土砖瓦片或塑料网格片来防止龟乱下蛋，这样龟就只能选择在龟窝区域产卵。（具体繁殖细节，将在琉球黄缘的下篇里详细解说）\n\n冬眠季节需要封住洞口，冬眠季节，龟窝的洞口需要封闭，以避免冷风直接吹入，也可以防止一些敌害动物进入。同时加厚稻草或落叶层，最冷的时候最好给龟窝覆盖上塑料布、保温板等保温挡风材料，防止冻害发生。当然，可以收回室内冬眠是最稳妥的。\n琉球黄缘虽然原生在亚热带，但是耐寒性也非常好，完全可以和安缘一样的冬眠。但是当年幼苗最好需要特殊照顾一下，建议加温过冬或短期加温延长生长期。\n\n琉球黄缘（下篇）：做饭吃饭、生娃养娃\n日常伙食\n总体来说，琉球黄缘的食物和其他黄缘没有多大区别，以荤素搭配，并以植物性食物占大半比例为宜。人工饲养条件下，基本没法做到完全模拟野生食谱，所以饲养上用到的食材以当地日常比较容易获取的蔬果、龟粮、昆虫等混搭制作。\n\n好用的手动碎菜机，比较便宜易得的蔬果莫过于香蕉和番茄了，尤其是香蕉，即便是在内地，一年四季的价格也非常稳定便宜。而番茄在夏季也非常便宜，而且除了蒂部之外都是可食部分，这对于饲喂量较大的我，是非常合适的蔬果选择。或许有人说香蕉营养价值比较低，吃多了滑肠、粪便不成型。如果单纯喂这些肯定营养不够，我经常用香蕉和番茄，是因为这些具有龟喜欢的香味和颜色，龟很爱吃，用它们和龟粮等其他混合，可以起到诱食的作用。我通常采用碎菜机把香蕉、番茄打成碎块备用，打碎后会析出很多果汁，这些汁水就是食物里重要的水分来源。\n\n龟粮和虫干、虫粉混合，伙食的蛋白质主要来源还是依靠龟粮，为了增加风味物质和多种蛋白质以及微量元素，我习惯再加入无菌蝇蛆干、黑水虻干、混合虫粉等等材料。\n\n搅拌混合均匀，将打碎的香蕉番茄和龟粮、虫干混合，一般情况下无需加水，搅拌均匀后，果汁会浸润软化龟粮虫干。尽量多放置一会儿，让饲料充分吸收水分。（需要注意的是一些大棚催熟的番茄，果肉结实，打碎后汁水较少，可以适当加水补充。）有条件的，可以再加一点活虫，可以激发龟的食欲。\n\n特别加入锦鲤扬色饲料颗粒，老熟南瓜也是我常用的龟粮搭配。老南瓜需要去皮切块上锅蒸熟，再捣成泥状。制作过程相对麻烦一些，龟少的情况可以一次多蒸点再分盒冷冻备用。另外除了龟粮，我们还可以加入一些锦鲤粮或者少量猫狗粮作为营养补充。\n\n白色粉末为钙粉，黄色为复合维生素粉。我们还可以加入适量的钙粉和复合维生素，尤其是龟的繁殖季节，添加钙粉可以提高蛋的质量。夏季高温季节，还可以加入适量大蒜素，一方面起到促进食欲的作用，另外还有一定的延缓食物腐败的作用。\n\n喂龟的食物可以因地制宜，比如我在琉球黄缘的饲养场地内就种植有无花果，成熟的果实就是龟非常爱吃的点心。另外利用空闲土地种植的桑葚和南瓜都是优质无污染的好食材。夏季雨后，地上会钻出很多蚯蚓，龟可以自由采食。\n\n自己加工混合虫粉。黄缘在野生环境里，蠕虫、昆虫是它们最主要的蛋白质来源，同时这些富含花青素和各种微量元素的天然食物也是造就野生龟野性、靓色的重要原因。人工环境下就难以提供更多种类的活体虫子，于是我就采购多达十余种的虫干来加工磨粉，这些混合虫粉使用起来也非常方便，在每次喂食的时候根据总的食物量，适量加入，作为营养补充。\n\n利用多个喂食器分散喂食，做好的食物，对于黄缘这类陆地进食的品种，可以使用不锈钢喂食器或盘子喂食，尽量减少龟对食物的踩踏浪费。建议多个喂食器分散喂食，避免龟扎堆堆叠。另外这样加工好的食物，不仅仅喂黄缘、木雕等半水龟，同样可以喂水龟。将混合食物捏成团，贴在水龟晒台斜坡靠近水面的地方即可。\n开饭时间\n在生长季节里，成体缘我一般隔天喂一次，春秋季喂食间隔拉长。喂食时间通常在早晨和傍晚时段，这个时间也是琉球黄缘的活跃时段。我通常中午开始准备食材，现场制作需要花费较多的时间，比如切蔬菜水果、蒸南瓜，蒸好的南瓜泥还需要有一个冷却的时间，各种食物拌和还需要一个水分浸润渗透的时间。这样全部弄好，趁新鲜就在傍晚喂给龟吃。\n\n琉球缘的嗅觉灵敏，会很快的找到食物，根据季节和气温的不同，喂食的时间从下午16点到19点不等。比如气温较低，阳光弱的时候，我会提早喂；高温季节，日落较晚，我就等太阳西斜后再喂。总之，是要顺应龟的活动规律来把握喂食时间。尤其是夏季高温季节，傍晚喂食的好处是即便食物有残余，夜间温度较低，食物腐败速度也较慢，这样也大大降低了食物腐败致病的概率。\n\n分散喂食，避免龟堆叠翻入喂食器内，固定时间段和固定地点喂食，可以让龟形成条件反射，到了时间就会聚集在喂食地点等待食物。这样不仅仅方便我们日常操作，也可以更方便的观察到龟的状态。\n\n次日早上回收喂食器，因为傍晚喂食，龟吃完后天色渐黑，而且会有部分害羞的龟个体会等别的龟吃完后再来吃点残羹剩饭，所以不方便再收拾。我通常次日早上或上午才回收喂食器，通过观察食物残余量来确定下次的食物制作。收回的食盆，清洗干净后，放在太阳下暴晒消毒，以便下次使用。\n交配繁殖\n琉球黄缘主要在春季和秋季交配。公龟会对母龟围追堵截，鼻孔喷气，摇头晃脑。更有甚者，咬住母的背甲前缘一通乱摇，实在很不绅士。\n\n待到情浓，母的自然会配合，交配行为也很容易完成。倘若母的不发情，闭起壳来，公的再强也没有办法的。\n\n体型较大的公显然有交配的优势，不只是说体型大容易交配的上，更重要是体型大的个体可能更容易俘获雌性的芳心。大部分雌性动物都会天然的优先选择体格健壮的雄性作伴侣来繁育后代，大概就是人类之中的所谓高富帅吧！\n\n人工繁育条件下，如果某只雄性黄缘非常强悍，就会占有更多的交配权，同时会攻击驱赶其他雄性，这样可能会影响整个种群所产生蛋的受精率。我们可以通过增大环境来减少这种冲突，环境太小的也可以通过定期隔离和交换公龟的方式来保证产蛋的受精率。\n产蛋 &amp; 挖蛋\n\n琉球黄缘和其它亚种的黄缘一样，都在春季产蛋。在长江中下游的气候下，琉球缘的产卵时间相对比安徽黄缘要晚20-50天左右。安徽黄缘通常在四月底五月初开始产卵，甚至早的有在四月初就下蛋了。琉球黄缘通常要到五月底和六月中上旬才开始产第一窝蛋，但是产蛋周期会延续到七月，甚至到八月上旬。\n\n琉球黄缘在春季会主动晒太阳，琉球黄缘在春季会花很多时间晒太阳，一方面因为春季昼夜温差大，整体温度较低，龟需要通过日晒提高体温，维持活动；更重要的是母龟需要吸收紫外线，来促进钙质形成，这样对于体内蛋的质量提高有很好的帮助。 \n\n琉球黄缘比较喜欢在枯草、落叶堆积的区域下蛋，这些区域一般湿度稳定且不易积水，而且蛋上面有较多的覆盖物，隐蔽而安全。我们设置产卵环境的时候，可以有意识的堆一些枯草或树叶，营造一个龟有安全感的环境。\n\n琉球黄缘的产卵土需要疏松，但是又要有一定的硬度。这样龟比较容易挖出不会坍塌的产卵洞穴。上图可以看到蛋周围的土有踩压过的痕迹，这并不是我挖蛋时候脚踩的，而是龟产卵后填埋洞穴，再用腹甲反复压平的痕迹。我就是凭借这个痕迹，准确的找到蛋的位置。\n\n黄缘其实也和水龟一样，会挖完整的产蛋洞穴\n很多人饲养过黄缘，觉得黄缘总是直接把蛋下在地上不埋，或者埋的很浅。就觉得黄缘的产卵行为就是这样。其实不埋或埋的很浅，和底材的性质有关。很多玩家把产卵土做的过于松软，龟很难挖出洞穴，多半产卵穴一边挖一边塌，这样蛋自然就露出土面，甚至被龟拨拉到土的表面。这样也造成龟偷蛋吃蛋的现象频发，其实这怪不得黄缘吃蛋，任何龟的蛋暴露在土表，都可能会招来同类偷吃。\n我个人观察到的是，琉球黄缘和安徽黄缘，都会像水龟一样，会花很多的时间用后肢挖出一个口小底大的口袋型洞穴，并且洞穴底部都有一个朝向龟头方向的拐弯。只有松软适度，具有一定粘性的土，才可以支撑一个完美洞穴的产生。口小的洞穴，蛋产在洞内，并且通常都被母龟安排在洞穴的尽头，即使有别的龟企图吃蛋，也是很难有机会抢到蛋的。产蛋穴的深度和龟的体型有关，琉球黄缘体型相对较小，因此洞穴距离土表的深度也相对较浅。但是通常都会埋的非常好，用手或铲子挖开都需要一定的力气，一般龟根本不太可能挖出蛋来吃掉。\n\n黄缘常选择排水良好的土坡上产卵。琉球黄缘常喜欢在植物根部周围或固定硬物的周边产卵，尤其是排水良好的土坡中上端下蛋。有经验的饲养者可以通过土表的蛛丝马迹找到产卵的地方。在环境里刻意做一些坡度，可以引导龟去你设置的区域下蛋。\n\n这窝蛋可能是两窝合一穴了。琉球黄缘的每窝蛋通常是1-4枚，更多的是两枚蛋一窝。挖蛋时候可以用工具平着刮土层，不要直接插土翻土，这样最大限度的避免挖碎蛋。\n\n当然每年总有挖碎的例子，要么是没找对产卵准确地点，在挖土的时候被工具铲子挖破；要么是挖蛋时间过长，体力下降，动作不协调，导致下手没轻重挖破。所以建议大家可以安装监控，能提前准确的获知产卵位置；再就是在大量养殖的情况下，合理安排挖蛋工作，避免一些不必要的损失。\n孵化出苗\n\n挖蛋、理蛋、孵蛋\n挖回来的蛋，检查过受精情况后，清理干净，即可进入孵化环节。有关龟蛋孵化可参看我之前发的挖蛋、孵蛋视频文章，本文结尾也有延伸阅读链接。\n\n琉球黄缘自然破壳。琉球黄缘蛋的孵化时间和安徽黄缘差别不大，孵化70-85天出壳。蛋发育到后期，蛋壳会变得酥脆，龟苗发育成熟后，会采用前肢撑开和破卵齿顶开的方式打开蛋壳。\n\n只要种龟环境做到位，龟营养能保证，蛋的孵化就很简单，基本不用人工干预，都可以自主出壳。\n\n新出生的琉球黄缘，已经具有鲜明的三棱特征。初生时候，背甲还没舒展开，更显得体型方正，侧棱更加突出。\n\n小胖墩。孵化过程中湿度保持的好，出壳的苗就非常饱满端正。理想的孵化状态，蛋内上部并没有明显的气室，龟刚刚破壳的时候，可以看到蛋内是充盈着透明的粘液的情况。\n\n相同产卵时间的蛋，出壳时间也比较接近，少部分会相差十余天。不同批次的蛋，孵化时间也有所差异。高温季节的蛋，因为积温比较高，孵化时间会比早期的蛋短几天。\n漏网之苗\n\n春天翻土发现的自然孵化的琉球缘苗\n每年总会有漏挖的蛋在饲养环境里自然孵化，直到春季甚至夏季才发现。这些土里爬出来的小琉球苗，虽然看起来灰头土脸，但是活力、体质都非常好。\n\n这只苗甚至在户外已经生活了一段时间，个头也长大了一些\n仿生环境里，有稳定的温湿度，一些没收集到的蛋，自然孵化的成功率还是挺高的。尤其重要的是土壤的湿度，很多人工环境土层过于薄，土层保有的水分散失速度较快，如果龟蛋埋在下面，就很容易干死，尤其是过了产卵季节，还要经历一个冬天，如果没有雨水或人工补水或保湿措施，恐怕漏挖的蛋都会脱水而死。\n\n我非常推荐在琉球黄缘的饲养环境里栽种植物，无论是地栽还是盆栽。有植物在，即便是室内环境没有自然雨水补充，你也会考虑到植物的成活而去及时浇水。植物根部吸收的水分或盆栽多余的水，都会滋润植物周边的土壤。而往往植物周边都是龟喜欢产卵的区域，这样其实营造了相对稳定的区域湿度。即便土表干燥，埋于土下的龟蛋也可以吸收深层土的湿气而顺利发育。\n\n泥疙瘩一样的自然孵化苗\n自然孵化出来的苗，转为人工饲养的时候，需要注意几点：\n1、虽然这些苗熬过了大自然的考验，但是饲养起来和人工孵化苗一样，仍然需要多用心。\n2、这些苗一直埋在土下或者在户外生存，吃到的东西很少，个头较小。人工饲养需要尽快补充营养，让它回到正常的生长模式上来。\n幼苗饲养\n通常当年的琉球缘苗，我是采用裸盆饲养。每天或隔天泡水、喂食，喂完等排便后，彻底清洗饲养容器。\n\n其实之前我也尝试过水养、苔藓饲养、土养，经过一些实践和经历失败，最终我选择适合我自身状况的裸盆饲养方法。早期是和很多玩家一样浅水饲养，这种方法其实优点突出，湿度不用操心，水养容易清洁，粪便清理容易，不容易滋生细菌。唯一缺点就是可能会出现翻车溺死的事件。土养和苔藓饲养比较接近，可以较好的保持湿度，粪便会被底材吸收，最符合缘的生活习性。但是缺点也很明显，就是不适合高密度的群养，因为小环境里的底材分解粪便能力比较有限，不能快速分解的粪便和食物残渣，就会滋生细菌，一旦照顾不周，就可能会造成肠炎、软甲等棘手的问题。\n\n饲养盒子其实就是普通鞋盒\n裸养方法其实就是水养的简化版。饲养容器可以使用周围打孔的塑料盒，必须加盖。加盖的用处是在保持通风的同时能够维持一定的空气湿度。定时清洗盒子，洗干净后泡水，并同时喂食。也可以拿出来放入干净的容器里集体喂食，利用喂食的时间，再去把原饲养盒清洗干净。\n\n每次清洗后盒内残余的水珠和少许余水，就可以维持盒内湿度1-3天。这样保持湿度的同时也避免了水养溺水和喝下粪便水的风险。这只是我饲养较多苗子，而且需要保证成活率和品相的个人办法，普通玩家饲养一两只，倒未必这样麻烦。但是注意清洗饲养盒，及时清理排泄物的思路都是一样的，尽可能杜绝细菌超标。\n\n泡水喂食，当年小苗尽量以龟粮喂食为主，可以直接在水里投喂颗粒饲料。在温度有保证的前提下，苗子的喂食频率要大一些，正常情况可以每天喂一点或者隔天喂食，尽快让龟多摄入营养，长好身体，这样才可以应对接下来的气温变化或冬眠考验。\n\n小苗建议以喂食龟粮为主。\n","id":"https://wendajiang.github.io/turtle/lq/","title":"琉球缘【转载】"},"https://wendajiang.github.io/turtle/winter-sleep-record/":{"body":"冬眠记录\n--

is type erasure\nType erasure, in general, is a programming technique by which the explicit type information is removed from the program. It is a type of abstraction that ensures that the program does not explicitly depend on some of the data types.\nThe aim here is to increase the level of abstraction -- instead of writing some type-specific code, perhaps serveral versions of it for different types, we can write just one version that is more abstract, and expressed the concept -- for example, instead of writing a function whose interface expresses the concept sort an array of integers, we want to write a more abstract function, sort any array.\nFrom example to generalization\nIn c++, std::function is a general-purpose polymorphic function wrapper, or a general callable object. It's used to store any callable entity such as a function, a lambda expression, a functor(an object with the operator()), or a memeber function pointer.\nstd::function&lt;size_t(const std::string&amp;)&gt; f;\nsize_t f1(const std::string&amp; s) {\n  return s.capacity();\n}\nf = f1;\nstd::cout &lt;&lt; f(\"abcde\"); // 15\nchar c = 'b';\nf = [=](const std::string&amp; s) { return s.find(c); }\nstd::cout &lt;&lt; f(\"abcde\"); // 1\nf = &amp;std::string::size;\nstd::cout &lt;&lt; f(\"abcde\"); // 5\n\nWe can now see type erasure in its more general form: it is an abstraction for many different implementations that all provide the same behavior.\nType erasue as a design pattern?\ntype erasure offers an non-intrusive way to separate the interface from the implementation. It's different from inheritance. We can say that type erasure provides \"external polyorphism\": there is no unifying hierarchy required, and the set of types that can be used to implement a particular abstraction is extensible, not limited to just classes derived from a common base.\nWhy doesn't type erasure completely replace inheritance in C++?\n\nperformance, high-performance implementations of type erasure became available only recently.\nconvenience.\n\nType erasure as an implementation technique\nType erasure is a great tool for breaking dependencies between components of a large system.\nFor example, we are building a large distributed software system, so one of our core components it the network communication layer:\nclass Network {\n  ...\n  void send(const char* data);\n  void receive(const char* buffer);\n  ...\n}\n\nNow, in one specific application, we have a need to process the data packets before and after they are sent across the network:\nclass Network {\n  ...\n  bool needs_processing;\n  void send(const char* data) {\n    if (needs_processing) apply_processing(buffer);\n    ...\n  }\n  ...\n}\n\nIs it a dependency nightmare: the low-level library now has to built with the apply_processing function from the specific application. Even worse, all other programs that do not require this functionality must still be compiled and linked with this code, even if they never set needs_processing.\nWhile this problem can be handled the 'old school' way - with some function pointer or (worse) global variables, type erasure offers an elegant solution:\nclass Network {\n  static const char* default_processor(const char* data) {\n    std::cout &lt;&lt; \"default processing\" &lt;&lt; std::endl;\n    return data;\n  }\n  std::function&lt;const char*(const char*)&gt; processor = default_processor;\n  void send(const char* data) {\n    data = processor(data);\n    ...\n  }\n  public:\n  template&lt;typename F&gt;\n  void set_processor(F&amp;&amp; f) {\n    processor = f;\n  }\n};\n\nThis is an example of the strategy design pattern, where the implementation of a particular behavior can be chosen at run-time.\nHow is type erasure implemented in C++?\nVery old type erasure\nint less(const void* a, const void* b) {\n  return *(const int*)a - *(const int*)b;\n}\nint main() {\n  int a[10] = {1, 10, 2, 9, 3, 8, 4, 7, 5, 0};\n  qsort(a, 10, sizeof(int), less);\n}\n// void qsort(void *base, size_t nmemb, size_t size, int (*compare)(const void*, const void*));\n\nThe major downside of this C approach is that the programmer is wholly responsible for ensuring that all the pieces of the type-erased code are consistent.\nIn C++, we can do a lot better, but the idea is still the same: the erased type is reified by the implementation of some type-specific code that is invoked through the type-agnostic interface. The key difference is that we are going to force the compiler to generate this code for use. There are, fundamentally, two techniues that can be used. The first one relies on run-time polymorphism(inheritance), and the second one uses template magic.\nType erasure using inheritance\ntemplate&lt;typename T&gt;\nclass smartptr {\n  struct destroy_base {\n    virtual void operator()(void*) = 0;\n    virtual ~destroy_base() {}\n  }\n  template&lt;typename Deleter&gt;\n  struct destory: public destory_base {\n    destroy(Deleter d): d_(d) {}\n    void operator()(void* p) override {\n      d_(static_cast&lt;T*&gt;(p));\n    }\n    Deleter d_;\n  }\n  public:\n  template&lt;typename Deleter&gt; smartptr(T* p, Deleter d):\n    p_(p), d_(new

destroy_base* d_;\n}\n\nBefor we learn the other (usually more efficient) way to implement type erasure, we have to address one glaringly obvious inefficiency in our design: every time we create or delete a shared pointer or a std::function object that is implemented as described above, we must allocate and deallocate memory for the derived object that conceals the erased type.\nType erasue without memory allocation\ntemplate&lt;typename T&gt;\nclass smartptr {\n  ...\n  public:\n    template&lt;typename Deleter&gt;\n    smartptr(T*p, Deleter d): p_(p) {\n

shell 启动进程所占用的资源，支持以下各种类型的限制：\n所创建的内核文件的大小、\n进程数据块的大小、\nShell 进程创建文件的大小、\n内存锁住的大小、\n常驻内存集的大小、\n打开文件描述符的数量、\n分配堆栈的最大大小、\nCPU 时间、\n单个用户的最大线程数、\nShell 进程所能使用的最大虚拟内存。同时，它支持硬资源和软资源的限制。\n作为临时限制，ulimit 可以作用于通过使用其命令登录的 shell 会话，在会话终止时便结束限制，并不影响于其他 shell 会话。而对于长期的固定限制，ulimit 命令语句又可以被添加到由登录 shell 读取的文件中，作用于特定的 shell 用户。\n2、使用ulimit\nulimit 通过一些参数选项来管理不同种类的系统资源。\nulimit 命令的格式为：ulimit [options] [limit]\n主要关注两个：\n1）open files：– 用户可以打开文件的最大数目\n对应ulimit 的命令ulimit -n，可以使用ulimit -n 临时设置。\n对应/etc/security/limits.conf的资源限制类型是：nofile\n* soft nofile 4096\n* hard nofile 4096\n2）max user processes – 用户可以开启进程/线程的最大数目\n对应ulimit 的命令ulimit  -u 临时修改max user processes的值：ulimit  -u  8192。\n对应/etc/security/limits.conf的资源限制类型是： noproc\n*      soft   nproc   8192\n具体的 options 含义以及简单示例可以参考以下表格。\nulimit 参数说明\n选项 含义-a 显示当前系统所有的limit资源信息。 -H 设置硬资源限制，一旦设置不能增加。例如：ulimit – Hs 64；限制硬资源，线程栈大小为 64K。-S 设置软资源限制，设置后可以增加，但是不能超过硬资源设置。例如：ulimit – Sn 32；限制软资源，32 个文件描述符。-c 最大的core文件的大小，以 blocks 为单位。例如：ulimit – c unlimited； 对生成的 core 文件的大小不进行限制。-f 进程可以创建文件的最大值，以blocks 为单位.例如：ulimit – f 2048；限制进程可以创建的最大文件大小为 2048 blocks。-d 进程最大的数据段的大小，以Kbytes 为单位。例如：ulimit -d unlimited；对进程的数据段大小不进行限制。-m 最大内存大小，以Kbytes为单位。例如：ulimit – m unlimited；对最大内存不进行限制。-n 可以打开的最大文件描述符的数量。例如：ulimit – n 128；限制最大可以使用 128 个文件描述符-s 线程栈大小，以Kbytes为单位。例如:ulimit – s 512；限制线程栈的大小为 512 Kbytes。-p 管道缓冲区的大小，以Kbytes 为单位。例如ulimit – p 512；限制管道缓冲区的大小为 512 Kbytes。-u 用户最大可用的进程数。例如 limit – u 65536；限制用户最多可以使用 65536个进程。-v 进程最大可用的虚拟内存，以Kbytes 为单位。ulimit – v 200000；限制最大可用的虚拟内存为 200000 Kbytes。-t 最大CPU占用时间，以秒为单位。ulimit – t unlimited；对最大的 CPU 占用时间不进行限制。-l 最大可加锁内存大小，以Kbytes 为单位。\n1\n我们可以通过以下几种方式来使用 ulimit：\n一、在用户的启动脚本中\n​    如果用户使用的是 bash，就可以在用户的目录下的 .bashrc 文件中，加入 ulimit – u 64，来限制用户最多可以使用 64 个进程。此外，可以在与 .bashrc 功能相当的启动脚本中加入 ulimt。\n二、在应用程序的启动脚本中\n如果用户要对某个应用程序 myapp 进行限制，可以写一个简单的脚本 startmyapp。\nulimit – s 512\nmyapp\n以后只要通过脚本 startmyapp 来启动应用程序，就可以限制应用程序 myapp 的线程栈大小为 512K。\n三、直接在控制台输入\nulimit – p 256 \n限制管道的缓冲区为 256K。\n四、修改所有 linux 用户的环境变量文件：\nvi /etc/profile\nulimit -u 10000\nulimit -n 4096\nulimit -d unlimited\nulimit -m unlimited\nulimit -s unlimited\nulimit -t unlimited\nulimit -v unlimited\n保存后运行#source /etc/profile 使其生效\n四、也可以针对单个用户的.bash_profile设置：\nvi ~./.bash_profile\n#ulimit -n 1024\n重新登陆ok\n3、用户进程的有效范围\nulimit 作为对资源使用限制的一种工作，是有其作用范围的。那么，它限制的对象是单个用户，单个进程，还是整个系统呢？事实上，ulimit 限制的是当前 shell 进程以及其派生的子进程。举例来说，如果用户同时运行了两个 shell 终端进程，只在其中一个环境中执行了 ulimit – s 100，则该 shell 进程里创建文件的大小收到相应的限制，而同时另一个 shell终端包括其上运行的子程序都不会受其影响：\nShell 进程 1\nulimit –s 100\ncat testFile &gt; newFile\nFile size limit exceeded\nShell 进程 2\ncat testFile &gt; newFile\nls –s newFile\n323669 newFile\n针对用户永久生效：\n那么，是否有针对某个具体用户的资源加以限制的方法呢？答案是有的，方法是通过修改系统的 /etc/security/limits.conf配置文件。该文件不仅能限制指定用户的资源使用，还能限制指定组的资源使用。该文件的每一行都是对限定的一个描述。\nlimits.conf的格式如下：\n                  \nusername|@groupname    type    resource      limit\ndomain：username|@groupname：设置需要被限制的用户名，组名前面加@和用户名区别。也可以用通配符*来做所有用户的限制。\ntype：有 soft，hard 和 -，soft 指的是当前系统生效的设置值。hard 表明系统中所能设定的最大值。soft 的最大值不能超过hard的值。用 – 就表明同时设置了 soft 和 hard 的值。\nresource：\ncore – 限制内核文件的大小\ndate – 最大数据大小\nfsize – 最大文件大小\nmemlock – 最大锁定内存地址空间\nnofile – 打开文件的最大数目\nrss – 最大持久设置大小\nstack – 最大栈大小\ncpu – 以分钟为单位的最多 CPU 时间\nnoproc – 进程的最大数目（系统的最大进程数）\nas – 地址空间限制\nmaxlogins – 此用户允许登录的最大数目\n要使 limits.conf 文件配置生效，必须要确保 pam_limits.so 文件被加入到启动文件中。\n查看 /etc/pam.d/login 文件中有：\nsession required /lib/security/pam_limits.so\n例如：解除 Linux 系统的最大进程数和最大文件打开数限制：\n​    vi /etc/security/limits.conf\n​    # 添加如下的行\n​    * soft noproc 20000 #软连接\n​    * hard noproc 20000  #硬连接\n​    * soft nofile 4096\n​    * hard nofile 4096\n​    说明：* 代表针对所有用户，noproc 是代表最大进程数，nofile 是代表最大文件打开数\n需要注意一点：/etc/security/limits.d下也有noproc最大进参数的限制：\n即 /etc/security/limits.d/下的文件覆盖了/etc/security/limits.conf设置的值 \n这个是官网答疑：https://access.redhat.com/solutions/406663\n# /etc/security/limits.conf\n#This file sets the resource limits for the users logged in via PAM.\n#It does not affect resource limits of the system services.\n#Also note that configuration files in /etc/security/limits.d directory,\n#That means for example that setting a limit for wildcard domain here\n[root@tr10-46-65-29 ~]# cat /etc/security/limits.d/20-nproc.conf \n# Default limit for number of user's processes to prevent\n# accidental fork bombs.\n# See rhbz #432903 for reasoning.\n*      soft   nproc   8192\nroot    soft   nproc   unlimited\n现在已经可以对进程和用户分别做资源限制了，看似已经足够了，其实不然。很多应用需要对整个系统的资源使用做一个总的限制，这时候我们需要修改 /proc 下的配置文件。/proc 目录下包含了很多系统当前状态的参数，例如 /proc/sys/kernel/pid_max，/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range 等等，从文件的名字大致可以猜出所限制的资源种类。\n注意：\n通过读取/proc/sys/fs/file-nr可以看到当前使用的文件描述符总数。另外，对于文件描述符的配置，需要注意以下几点：\n所有进程打开的文件描述符数不能超过/proc/sys/fs/file-max\n单个进程打开的文件描述符数不能超过user limit中nofile的soft limit\nnofile的soft limit不能超过其hard limit\nnofile的hard limit不能超过/proc/sys/fs/nr_open\n4、用户进程的有效范围\n问题1：su切换用户时提示：Resource temporarily unavailable\n或者通过进程跟踪 strace -p pid 看到:Resource temporarily unavailab\n通过ulimit -a，得到结果：\ncore file size      (blocks, -c) 0\ndata seg size      (kbytes, -d) unlimited\nscheduling priority       (-e) 0\nfile size        (blocks, -f) unlimited\npending signals         (-i) 63463\nmax locked memory    (kbytes, -l) 64\nmax memory size     (kbytes, -m) unlimited\nopen files            (-n) 65535\npipe size       (512 bytes, -p) 8\nPOSIX message queues   (bytes, -q) 819200\nreal-time priority        (-r) 0\nstack size        (kbytes, -s) 8192\ncpu time        (seconds, -t) unlimited\nmax user processes        (-u) 4096\nvirtual memory      (kbytes, -v) unlimited\nfile locks            (-x) unlimited\n在上面这些参数中，通常我们关注得比较多:\nopen files: 一个进程可打开的最大文件数.\nmax user processes: 系统允许创建的最大进程数量.\n通过 ps -efL|grep java |wc -l\n#24001\n这个得到的线程数竟然是2万多，远远超过4096\n我们可以使用 ulimit -u 20000 修改max user processes的值，但是只能在当前终端的这个session里面生效，重新登录后仍然是使用系统默认值。\n正确的修改方式是修改/etc/security/limits.d/20-nproc.conf文件中的值。先看一下这个文件包含什么：\n$ cat /etc/security/limits.d/90-nproc.conf # Default limit for number of user's processes to prevent# accidental fork bombs.# See rhbz #432903 for reasoning.*     soft  nproc  8192\n我们只要修改上面文件中的8192这个值，即可。\n问题2：linux 打开文件数 too many open files 解决方法\n在运行某些命令或者 tomcat等服务器持续运行 一段时间后可能遇到  too many open files。\n出现这句提示的原因是程序打开的文件/socket连接数量超过系统设定值。\njava进程如果遇到java.net.SocketException: Too many open files，接着可能导致域名解析ava.net.UnknownHostException:\n原因是用户进程无法打开系统文件了。\n查看每个用户最大允许打开文件数量\nulimit -a\n其中 open files (-n) 65535 表示每个用户最大允许打开的文件数量是65535 。 默认是1024。1024很容易不够用。\n永久修改open files 方法\nvim /etc/security/limits.conf\n在最后加入\n* soft nofile 65535 \n* hard nofile 65535\n或者只加入\n* - nofile 65535\n最前的 * 表示所有用户，可根据需要设置某一用户，例如\nfdipzone soft nofile 8192\nfdipzone hard nofile 8192\n注意\"nofile\"项有两个可能的限制措施。就是项下的hard和soft。 要使修改过得最大打开文件数生效，必须对这两种限制进行设定。 如果使用\"-\"字符设定, 则hard和soft设定会同时被设定。 \n改完后注销一下就能生效。\n通过 ulimit -n或者ulimit -a 查看系统的最大文件打开数已经生效了。但此时查看进程的最大文件打开数没有变，原因是这个值是在进程启动的时候设定的，要生效必须重启！\nok，那就重启吧，重启完毕，结果发现依然没变！这奇了怪了，后来经过好久的排查，最终确认问题是，该程序是通过 supervisord来管理的，也就是这进程都是 supervisord 的子进程，而 supervisord 的最大文件打开数还是老的配置，此时必须重启 supervisord 才可以。\n当大家遇到limits修改不生效的时候，请查一下进程是否只是子进程，如果是，那就要把父进程也一并重启才可以。\n1. limits是一个进程的资源，会被子进程继承\n2. soft limit -S, hard limits -H\nhard limits只能被root用户修改，启动的时候会加载配置/etc/security/limits.conf\nsoft limits可以被任何用户修改，但不能超过hard limits\n3. 在linux下，每个进程的limit信息保存在/proc/PID/limits文件中(linux OS kenerl &gt; 2.6.24)。低于2.6.24版本的kenerl需要手动统计 /proc/PID/fd下面有多个少个文件。\n4. lsof -p pid显示所有的打开文件包括shared library\nlsof 会统计一些duplicate的open file\n5. system-wide fd\nsysctl -a\nvim /etc/sysctl.conf\n6. max open file on the system\ncat /proc/sys/fs/file-max\n7. stat the openning file from the kenerl point of view\ncat /proc/sys/fs/file-nr \n864     0       3274116\nhave 864 out of max 3274116 open files\n\n8.利用lsof统计每个进程打开的文件数目\nlsof -n |awk '{print $2}'|sort|uniq -c |sort -nr|more \n\n9. 设置普通用户下打开文件的最大值\nulimit -n 4096\n-bash: ulimit: open files: cannot modify limit: Operation not permitted\n9.1 在/etc/security/limits.conf中添加\n\nhard nofile 100000\nsoft nofile 100000\n\n9.2 /etc/pam.d/login 添加\nsession required     /lib64/security/pam_limits.so\n9.3 重启 ssh2和rccron，这样只进程就自动继承了nofile\n/etc/init.d/ssh2 restart\nrccron restart\n","id":"https://wendajiang.github.io/ulimit/","title":"Linux ulimit"},"https://wendajiang.github.io/visitor/":{"body":"what is visitor pattern\nA pattern that separates the algorithm from the object structure, which is the data for the algorithm. Using the visitor pattern, we can add a new operation to the class hierarchy without modifying the classes themselves.\nDifferent, more technical way to describe the visitor pattern is to say that it implements double dispatch. Let's explain the term.\nclass Base {\n  virtual void f() = 0;\n};\nclass D1 : public Base {\n  void f() override;\n};\nclass D2: public Base {\n  void f() override;\n};\n\nThe regular virtual function calls, if we invoke the b-&gt;f()  virtual function through a pointer to the base class, the call is dispatched to D1::f() or D2::f(), depending on the real type of the object. This is the single dispatch. Now let's assume that the function f() also take an argument that is the pointer to a base class:\nclass Base {\n  virtual void f(Base *p) = 0;\n};\nclass D1 : public Base {\n  void f(Base *p) override;\n};\nclass D2: public Base {\n  void f(Base *p) override;\n};\n\nThis would be double dispatch.\nwhy we need visitor pattern\nWhy would we want to add an operation externally instaed of implementing it in every class in herarchy class-tree? Consider the example of the serialization/deserialization problem.\nFor example, we may need to write an object into a memory buffer, to be transmitted across the network and decerialized on another machine. Alternatively, we may need to save the object to disk, or else we may need to convert all objects in a container to a markup format such as JSON.\n\nThe straighforward approach would have us add a serialization and a deserialization method to every object for every serialization machanism. If a new and different serialization approach is needed, we have to go over the entire class hierarchy and add support for it.\nAn alternative is to implement the entire serialization/deserialization operation in a separate function that can handle all classes. The resulting code is a loop that iterates over all objects, with a large decision tree inside of it. The code must interrogate every object and determine its type, for example, using dynamic casts. When a new class is added to the hierarchy, all serialization and deserialization implementations must be updated to handle the new objects.\n\nBoth are difficult to maintain for large hierarchies. The visitor pattern offers a solution.\nvisitor pattern\nclass Pet {\n  public:\n  virtual ~Pet() {}\n  Pet(std::string&amp; color): color_(color) {}\n  const std:string&amp; color() const {\n    return color_;\n  }\n  private: \n  const std::string color_;\n};\nclass Cat: public Pet {\n  public:\n  Cat(std::string&amp; color): Pet(color) {}\n};\nclass Dog: public Pet {\n  public:\n  Dog(std::string&amp; color): Pet(color) {}\n};\n\nNow we want to add some operations to ousr classes, such as \"feed the pet\" or \"play with the pet\"\nclass Cat;\nclass Dog;\nclass PetVisitor {\n  public:\n  virtual void visitor(Cat* c) = 0;\n  virtual void visitor(Dog* d) = 0;\n};\n\nWe need to make the Pet hierarchy visitable, which means we do need to modify it, but only once, regradless of how many operations we want to add later.\nclass Pet {\n  public:\n  virtual void accept(PetVisitor&amp; v) = 0;\n  ...\n};\nclass Cat {\n  public:\n  void accept(PetVisitor&amp; v) override {\n    v.visit(this);\n  }\n  ...\n};\nclass Dog {\n  public:\n  void accept(PetVisitor&amp; v) override {\n    v.visit(this);\n  }\n  ...\n};\n\nNow out Pet hierarchy is visitable, and we have an abstract PetVisitor class. Everything is ready to implement new operations for our classes.\nclass FeedingVisitor: public PetVisitor {\n  public: \n  void visit(Cat *c) override {\n    std::cout &lt;&lt; \"Feeding to the \" &lt;&lt; c-&gt;color() &lt;&lt; \"cat\" &lt;&lt; std::endl;\n  }\n  void visit(Dog *d) override {\n    std::cout &lt;&lt; \"Feeding to the \" &lt;&lt; d-&gt;color() &lt;&lt; \"dog\" &lt;&lt; std::endl;\n  }\n};\nclass PlayingVisitor: public PetVisitor {\n  public: \n  void visit(Cat *c) override {\n    std::cout &lt;&lt; \"Playing with the \" &lt;&lt; c-&gt;color() &lt;&lt; \"cat\" &lt;&lt; std::endl;\n  }\n  void visit(Dog *d) override {\n    std::cout &lt;&lt; \"Playing with the \" &lt;&lt; d-&gt;color() &lt;&lt; \"dog\" &lt;&lt; std::endl;\n  }\n};\n\nThe call accept() ends up dispatched to a particular visit() function based on two factors - the type of the visitable *p object and the type of the *v visitor. Stress the aspect of the visitor pattern, we can write code like this:\nvoid dispatch(Pet&amp; p, PetVisitor&amp; v) {\n  p.accept(v);\n}\nstd::unique_ptr&lt;Pet&gt; p = ...;\nstd::unique_ptr&lt;PetVisitor&gt; v = ...;\ndisplay(*p, *v); // double dispatch\n\nvisit complex objects\nThe correct way to handle the component objects is to simply visit each one, and thus delegate the problem to someone else.\n","id":"https://wendajiang.github.io/visitor/","title":"visitor pattern"},"https://wendajiang.github.io/welcome-to-david/":{"body":"\n","id":"https://wendajiang.github.io/welcome-to-david/","title":"Welcome to wendajiang!"},"https://wendajiang.github.io/why-impl-network-stack-in-kernel/":{"body":"\n为什么TCP协议栈实现在Linux内核中\nhttps://blog.cloudflare.com/why-we-use-the-linux-kernels-tcp-stack\nCloudFlare提出工作经验在于大量的生产环境的机器，尝试在这个角度给出理解。\n从一个更广泛的问题切入---操作系统运行的意义是什么？如果是计划运行一个应用程序，必须使用数百万行代码组成内核，似乎是负担。但是事实上，我们会运行某种类型的OS，有两个理由：\n\n操作系统层提供了更容易使用的硬件抽象API，可以专注于写机器无关的代码\n操作系统增加了时分系统，使得同一个时间可以运行多个应用，比如运行HTTP服务器和Bash session，在多个进程共享资源的能力是很重要的，纳入操作系统管理的资源可以被多个进程共享\n\n用户空间的网络\n对于协议栈来说没有什么不同，通过操作系统网络协议栈的通用性，我们可以获得运行多个网络应用的能力。如果将网卡硬件运行用户空间的网络协议栈专用于运行单个应用，这个能力就没了。通过一个进程获取网卡，你将失去与服务同时运行比如SSH会话的能力\n听起来很疯狂，这正是大多数现成的用户空间网络协议栈提出的。通用术语是“完全内核旁路（full kernel by pass）”，这个想法是绕过内核，直接从用户空间进程使用网络硬件。\n在Linux生态系统中，有一些可用技术，并非全部都是开源的：\n\nPF_RING\nSnabbswitch\nDPDK\nNetmap\n\n在之前的文章中已经写过 kernelbypass，所有的这些技术都需要将整个网卡移交给一个进程，换句话说：完全可以编写自己的网络协议栈，使其出色，专注于超级功能，并针对性进行性能优化。但是这会产生很大的成本---你将被限制为每个网卡最多运行一个进程。\n关于虚拟化网卡（VFs），让我们专门提一下---这不起作用，在这篇文章中the \"Virtualization approach\" paragraph提到过。\n但是即使有些障碍，我还是不能忽略kernel bypass的好处，许多人确实运行自定义的网络协议栈，因为两个原因：\n\n时延\n性能（更低的CPU开销，更好的吞吐量）\n\n延迟对于HFT（高频交易）人员非常重要，交易者可以负担起定制硬件和专有的网络协议栈。运行封闭的TCP堆栈会让其非常不舒服\nKernel bypass at CloudFlare\n就像已经说过的，CloudFlare使用旁路内核技术（kernel bypass）。我们属于第二个群体，关注性能。更具体地说，我们遭受IRQ风暴的影响。Linux网络协议栈有一个每秒处理多少包的限制。当达到限制后，所有的CPU变得忙，仅接受数据包。在这种情况下，要不丢弃数据包，要不应用程序卡死（CPU被占满）。一般我们不需要处理IRQ风暴，但是当受到L3层的DDos攻击时，确实会发生这种情况。这种攻击充斥着不属于有效连接的数据包，典型的欺骗数据包。\n在受到攻击期间，我们被洪泛到每秒3M数据包量。Linux的iptables的通用规则可以处理1Mbps的包速很好，并且可以继续提供足够的CPU给应用使用。这个数字还可以通过调优有所提升。\n当攻击的规模变大，Linux内核能力不足以应付时，我们必须能够处理这种情况，但是我们不采用前面提到的“full kernel bypass”，使用我们叫做\"partial kernel bypass\"。在内核拥有网络硬件的同时，允许我们处理仅通过一个“RX queue”旁路出来的数据包。我们在Solarflare NIC上使用Solarflare's EFVI API。为了支持Intel NIC，我们在Netmap中添加了部分旁路内核的功能。通过这种技术，可以将防御DDoS iptables卸载到非常快速的用户空间进程中，这种可以避免Linux内核处理攻击数据包，从而避免IRQ风暴。\n完整的用户空间网络协议栈呢\n我的同事经常问我：为什么我们不适用快速用户空间TCP协议栈运行带有Solarflare OpenOnLoad框架的Nginx？是的，那将很快，但是没有证据表明它会产生多大的实际差异。我们服务器上的CPU大部分都用于运行用户空间的Nginx，操作系统并没有使用多少。CPU主要用于常规的Nginx记录和Lua应用逻辑，而不是网络处理。我估计使用旁路可以节省大约5~10%的CPU，但是这目前并不值得\n其次，为了Nginx使用旁路内核技术将是的我们常用的调试工具失效。Linux netstat统计将停止记录，tcpdump也将失效。\n然后缓解DDoS的部分旁路协议栈也存在一些问题，我们重度依赖iptables，。自定义的TCP协议栈没有类似'hashlimits'和'ipsets'这种功能。\n而且不仅是防火墙功能，Linux TCP协议栈还提供了一些RFC4821 sys.net.ipv4.tcp_mut_probing sysctl 的非平凡支持。这些支持对于党用户位于ICMP黑洞后面时非常有用。（PMTU）\n最后，每种TCP协议栈都有一些自己实现上的bug和quirks。我们已经整理了三种Linux协议栈中不明显的quirks：\n\n垃圾收集器插入读取缓冲区（https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-story-of-one-latency-spike/）\n当太多的监听socket时的问题\n套接字可写意味着什么（https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-curious-case-of-slow-downloads/）\n\n想象一下在封闭的源码或者年轻的TCP协议栈中调试问题。\n结论\n有两个主要话题：\n首先，没有稳定开源的partial kernel bypass技术，我们希望Netmap能填补这个空白。其次，Linux内核TCP协议栈有许多重要特性和良好的debug能力。这个丰富的生态系统竞争将需要多年。\n有很多理由用户空间协议栈不会成为主流，事实上，我只能想到有限应用需要旁路内核功能：\n\n软件交换机和路由器。这里你希望直接处理网络硬件的原始数据包，绕过内核\n专用负载均衡器。相似地，如果机器只需要处理数据包，绕过内核就很有用\n部分旁路为了挑选出来的高吞吐/低延迟的应用。这是我们对于DDoS的调整。不幸的是，我不知道其他的适合此场景的其他的开源TCP协议栈\n\n对于大多数用户Linux内核协议栈就是很好的选择。尽管没有重写TCP协议栈那么让人兴奋，we should focus on understanding the Linux stack performance and fixing its problems.There are some serious initiatives underway to improve the performance of the good old Linux TCP stack.\n@todo其中的链接看一下\n","id":"https://wendajiang.github.io/why-impl-network-stack-in-kernel/","title":"【翻译】为什么协议栈在内核中实现"},"https://wendajiang.github.io/yet-another-implement-of-lock-free-circular-array-queue/":{"body":"原链接\n推荐：\nLock-free Programming\nhttps://preshing.com/20120612/an-introduction-to-lock-free-programming/\n1. Introduction\n毫无疑问，当今提升应用的性能的一个方式就是：并发。Thread 已经存在很长时间了，过去，大多数计算机只有一个处理器核心时，线程主要用于将总任务分解为小的执行单元，从而使一些执行单元等待资源的时候，可以执行其他执行单元。一个简单的例子是，监听TCP端口的网络应用，请求到达该端口之后会进行一些处理。在单线程方式下，应用直到处理完这个请求不能响应更多的请求，因此可能用户会认为这个应用宕机了。多线程时，可以由新线程处理请求，主线程一直监听请求。\n单处理器计算机上，使用多线程的应用程序可能不会达到预期的结果。为了使处理器工作，多个线程可能互相影响，比如多个线程的通信的开销和共享数据，最终甚至不如单线程应用的性能好。\n在SMP(symmetric multiprocessing)上，多线程应用可以同时（译者注：物理上的同时）work。每个线程使用一个物理处理器核心。在 N-处理器机器上运行 N-thread 程序理论上可以节省 N 倍的运行时间（当然实际上由于通信开销和共享数据开销，没有达到理论值）\nSMP机器在过去很昂贵，只有极力推崇这种软件（译者注：大公司？）才能负担起费用，但是当今时代，多核处理器越来越便宜，所以将应用并发获得更高的性能越来越流行。\n但是并发开发不是简单的工作。线程必须共享数据并互相通信，你会发现你面对的都是相同的老问题：死锁，共享数据失控，跨线程动态内存分配/销毁等。此外，如果你有幸在开发具有高性能（并发）的应用，你还会发现一系列不同的问题，有些会严重影响性能：\n\nCache Trashing\nContention on your synchonization mechanism. Queues\nDynamic memory allocation\n\n本文就提出了通过使用 array based lock-free queue 来最小化上面三个问题对性能的影响。尤其是动态内存分配的使用，因为这是设计无锁队列时的主要目标\n2. How synchronizing threads can reduce the overall performance\n\n2.1 Cache trashing\nThreads are (from Wikipedia): \"the smallest unit of processing that can be scheduled by an operating system\".每个系统有自己的线程实现，但是基本是一个进程内的指令集合加上一些进程内的local内存。线程执行一些指令，但是共享进程的内存空间。在Linux中（本文中写的queue优先在这个系统上执行），一个线程就是“执行的上下文（context of execution）”，没有线程概念。Linux 将线程实现为标准进程。Linux 内核没有提供任何关于线程特殊的调度语义或者数据结构。线程仅仅是与其他进程共享某些资源的进程。\n每个执行的任务，线程，执行上下文，随你怎么称呼它【译者注：任务，线程，执行上下文在本文中同义】，使用一系列 CPU 的寄存器去运行。它们包含了任务的内部数据，比如正在执行的指令地址，操作或者操作结果，栈的指针等。这些信息就叫做“context（上下文）”。任何抢占式系统（大多数现代系统是抢占式的）都必须能够在几乎任何地方停止正在运行的任务，将上下文保存在某个地方，以便将来还原时使用（少数例外系统，比如进程声明自己一段时间使用CPU）。任务恢复后，就从停止的地方继续执行，就像没有什么发生一样。处理器是多任务共享的，所以等待 IO 的任务就可以被其它任务抢占。单处理系统上表现的想多处理器一样，但是就像生活的所有事情一样，存在 trade-off：处理器共享，但是每次任务被抢占，都会存在上下文保存和恢复的开销。\n在save/restore context 过程中，存在隐藏开销：存在 cache中的数据是之前任务的，对于新任务无用。考虑到处理器比内存处理速度快几倍，所以大量的时间浪费在等待从内存读写数据到处理器。这也是 cache 在处理器和标准 RAM memory 之间的原因。Cache 很小但是很快，用于保存在不久将来会被访问的从 RAM memory 复制的数据。在处理密集型程序中，缓存miss对于性能影响非常大，如果没有缓存miss，性能将会有几倍的提升。\n所以每次任务被强占 cache 都会被重写，这意味着对于 CPU 来说恢复运行要等一段时间。（有些操作系统，比如 Linux 会试图在最后一个正在执行任务的处理器上还原进程，但是取决于最后一个进程需要的内存大小，cache仍然可能会失效【译者注：这里没看懂。。。】）。当然我不是说抢占是坏事，抢占对于系统正确运行是必要的，但是可能由于你的设计，有些线程过于频繁的被抢占，会由于 cache 垃圾大大降低性能\n什么时候任务会被抢占？取决于你的系统，但是中断处理，timers和系统调用很可能导致操作系统抢占子系统从而导致系统为其他进程分配处理时间。这是操作系统的难题一部分，因为没有人想要进程“饥饿”太长时间。某些系统调用处理“阻塞”状态，这意味着任务向操作系统请求资源继续执行。这是抢占式任务的很合适的例子，因为在资源准备好之前没有事情做，所以操作系统会挂起这个任务并执行其他任务。\n资源通常表示内存，硬盘，外围设备或者网络中的数据，阻塞的同步机制比如信号量或者互斥量。如果任务试图获取已经被持有的互斥量，就会被抢占，一旦互斥量被释放，线程就会被加入到“ready-to-run”的任务队列中。所以如果你担心任务被频繁抢占，应该尽可能避免使用阻塞同步机制。\n但是就像生活一样，没有事情是简单的。如果在避免使用阻塞同步机制的同时，使用的线程数量远多于物理处理器核心数，则可能会导致系统延迟。操作系统轮换任务的次数越少，任务等待执行的时间越长。甚至可能在应用整个生命周期内都一直等待空余出来的处理器。没有标准，依赖于你的应用和系统。比如，在处理密集的实时应用中，我会选择非阻塞机制同步线程，然后执行比物理核心更少的线程数，尽管这并不是万能药。在一些其他应用中，有大量等待数据的场景，比如网络，非阻塞同步会危害系统。没有不老之泉，每个方案都有其优势和局限，完全由你来决定如何选择。\n\n2.2 Contentin on your synchonization mechanism. Queues\nqueue可以轻松应用于各种多线程场景。如果多线程需要通信，第一个浮现在我脑海的就是 queue。易于理解，易于使用，方便测试，还易于传授【译者：:)】世界上的每个开发都应该会queue，它无处不在。\nqueue 易于在单线程程序中使用，并且可以简单地适配到多线程系统。你需要的就是一个没有保护的队列（比如 C++中的 std::queue）和阻塞的同步机制（比如 mutex 和 conditional variables）。我上传了一个简单的使用glib的阻塞队列实现，不过由于 GAysncQueue是已经包含在 glib 中的线程安全队列实现，所以并不需要这样一个重复造的轮子，但是这份代码是一个将标准队列转换为线程安全队列的绝佳例子。\n让我们来看下大多数 queue 中公共方法(IsEmpty, Push, Pop)的实现。基本无保护的 queue 是 std::queue声明为 std::queue&lt;t&gt; m_theQueue。三个非线程安全的方法实现使用 glib 的互斥量和条件变量（声明为GMutex* m_mutex Cond* m_cond）。从本文可以下载代码，还包含了TryPush,TryPop的方法实现，这两个方法当 queue 满或者空时不会阻塞。\ntemplate&lt;typename T&gt;\nbool BlockingQueue&lt;T&gt;::IsEmpty()\n{\n  bool rv;\n  g_mutex_lock(m_mutex);\n  rv = m_theQueue.empty();\n  g_mutex_unlock(m_mutex);\n  \n  return rv;\n}\n\nIsEmpty当queue没有元素时返回true，但是必须对这个原始队列加上保护，这意味着要使用这个队列的线程必须等待 mutex 被释放后才能使用。\ntemplate &lt;typename T&gt;\nbool BlockingQueue&lt;T&gt;::Push(const T &amp;a_elem)\n{\n    g_mutex_lock(m_mutex);\n\n    while (m_theQueue.size() &gt;= m_maximumSize)\n    {\n        g_cond_wait(m_cond, m_mutex);\n    }\n\n    bool queueEmpty = m_theQueue.empty();\n\n    m_theQueue.push(a_elem);\n\n    if (queueEmpty)\n    {\n        // wake up threads waiting for stuff\n        g_cond_broadcast(m_cond);\n    }\n\n    g_mutex_unlock(m_mutex);\n\n    return true;\n}\n\nPush往队列里插入元素。如果其他线程正在操作队列，这个线程会阻塞。如果队列已满，线程会阻塞，直到其他线程执行Pop操作，当然调用线程在等待其他线程弹出元素时不会占用任何 CPU 时间，因为操作系统已将其置为睡眠状态。\ntemplate&lt;typename T&gt;\nvoid BlockingQueue&lt;T&gt;::Pop(T &amp;out_data)\n{\n  g_mutex_lock(m_mutex);\n  while(m_theQueue.empty()) {\n    g_cond_wait(m_cond, m_mutex);\n  }\n  bool queueFull = (m_theQueue.size() &gt;= m_maximumSize) ? true : false;\n  \n  out_data = m_theQueue.front();\n  m_theQueue.pop();\n  \n  if (queueFull) {\n    // wake up threads waiting for stuff\n    g_cond_broadcase(m_cond);\n  }\n  \n  g_mutex_unlock(m_mutex);\n}\n\nPop从对列中弹出一个元素（并删除它）。要使用的线程会阻塞如果另一个线程正在使用该队列。如果队列是空的，线程会阻塞，直到有其他队列往队列里加入元素，当然在等待其他线程插入元素时不会占用 CPU 时间，因为已被置为睡眠状态。\n正如我在上一节解释的一样，阻塞不是一件平凡操作。它涉及操作系统将当前任务“挂起”，或者睡眠（不使用CPU等待）。一旦资源（比如mutex）可用，阻塞的任务就会被唤醒，同样不是平凡操作。**在负载很重的应用中使用这种阻塞队列在线程间传递消息就引起竞争，**意味着，将会花费大量时间（sleeping, waiting, awakenging）在试图访问queue，而不是执行真正的任务\n在最简单的场景中，一个生产者线程往队列插入数据，一个消费者线程消费数据，两个线程都在竞争线程安全队列的互斥量。如果我们自己来实现而不是包装现成的队列，就可以使用两个不同的互斥量，一个用来插入数据，一个用来弹出数据。这种实现里面，竞争只会发生在边界情况，就是队列满或者空之时。现在，一旦需要超过一个生产者线程或者消费者线程，问题就又回来了。\n这就是应用无阻塞机制的地方。Tasks don't \"fight\" for any resource, they \"reserve\" a place in the queue without being blocked or unblocked, and then they insert/remove data from the queue【译者注：这里不翻译】。这个机制需要一个特殊操作：CAS（Compare And Swap），维基百科中的定义：a special instruction that atomically compares the contents of a memory location to a given value and, only if they are the same, modifies the contents of that memory location to a given new value，举例如下\nvolatile int a;\na = 1;\n// this will loop while 'a' is not equal to 1. If it is equal to 1 the operation will atomically\n// set a to 2 and return true\nwhile(!CAS(&amp;a, 1, 2)) ;\n\n使用 CAS 实现lock-free 并不是新话题，有很多数据结构的示例，大部分使用链表举例。可以看看文献中2，3，4【译者注: 2,3 连接找不到了】，这里目的不是描述什么  lock-free queue，而是：\n\ninsert 新数据到新节点（malloc出来），然后使用CAS操作放到队列上\n从队列 remove 数据，使用 CAS 从链表上将节点删除\n\n这是链表 lock-free queue 的简单实现，从 2【译者注：反正找不到这个原文】 中复制，基于 5\ntypedef struct _Node Node;\ntypedef struct _Queue Queue;\n\nstruct _Node {\n    void *data;\n    Node *next;\n};\n\nstruct _Queue {\n    Node *head;\n    Node *tail;\n};\n\nQueue*\nqueue_new(void)\n{\n    Queue *q = g_slice_new(sizeof(Queue));\n    q-&gt;head = q-&gt;tail = g_slice_new0(sizeof(Node));\n    return q;\n}\n\nvoid\nqueue_enqueue(Queue *q, gpointer data)\n{\n    Node *node, *tail, *next;\n\n    node = g_slice_new(Node);\n    node-&gt;data = data;\n    node-&gt;next = NULL;\n\n    while (TRUE) {\n        tail = q-&gt;tail;\n        next = tail-&gt;next;\n        if (tail != q-&gt;tail)\n            continue;\n        if (next != NULL) {\n            CAS(&amp;q-&gt;tail, tail, next);\n            continue;\n        }\n        if (CAS(&amp;tail-&gt;next, null, node)\n            break;\n    }\n    CAS(&amp;q-&gt;tail, tail, node);\n}\n\ngpointer\nqueue_dequeue(Queue *q)\n{\n    Node *node, *tail, *next;\n    while (TRUE) {\n        head = q-&gt;head;\n        tail = q-&gt;tail;\n        next = head-&gt;next;\n        if (head != q-&gt;head)\n            continue;\n        if (next == NULL)\n            return NULL; // Empty\n        if (head == tail) {\n            CAS(&amp;q-&gt;tail, tail, next);\n            continue;\n        }\n        data = next-&gt;data;\n        if (CAS(&amp;q-&gt;head, head, next))\n            break;\n    }\n    g_slice_free(Node, head); // This isn't safe\n    return data;\n}\n\n在没有 GC 的语言中（C++就是其中之一），由于所谓的 ABA 问题 ，对g_slice_free的调用是不安全的：\n\nThread T1 reads a value to dequeue and stops just before the first call to CAS in queue_dequeue\nThread T1 is preemtped. T2 attempts a CAS operation to remove the same node T1 was about to dequeue\nIt succedes and frees the memory allocated for that node\nThat same thread (or a new one, for instace T3) is going to enqueue a new node. the call to malloc returns the same address that was being used by the node removed in step 2-3. It adds that node into the queue\nT1 takes the processor again, the CAS operation succeds incorrectly since the address is the same, but it's not the same node. T1 removes the wrong node\n\nABA 问题可以对每个节点加上引用计数解决。在假定CAS操作正确之前必须检查引用计数以避免 ABA 问题。不过好消息是，本文提到的 queue 不会受 ABA 问题影响，因为不使用动态内存分配。\n\n2.3 Dynamic memory allocation\n在多线程系统中，必须慎重考虑内存分配。标准内存分配机制在为一个任务在堆上分配内存时会阻塞所有共享内存空间的任务（进程内的所有线程）。这种方式简单正确，不会出现两个线程分配相同的地址，因为不会同时分配内存。但是当存在很多内存分配操作时就会导致性能很差（必须提到的是类似标准库中 queue 或者 map 的插入操作就会在堆上分配内存）\n有一些库可以覆盖标准分配机制，提供无锁的内存分配机制来减少堆的争用，比如，libhoard。有许多不同的类型的库，但是当你使用它们覆盖标准库操作时可能会对你的系统产生巨大的影响，因为你可能需要修改你的同步机制来适配无锁的内存分配机制。\n3. The circular array based lock-free queue\n在此基于 array 的 lock-free 的环形队列首次登场，尽可能降低第2节三个问题的影响。可以总结为以下特性：\n\n作为lock-free同步机制，降低了任务被强占的频率，从而降低了 cache trashing\n同样的作为 lock-free 队列，线程之间竞争减少，因为lock-free：线程基本上是先声明空间已被占用，然后将数据填入\n不需要在堆上分配空间\n不会受到 ABA 问题的影响，当然也加入了 array 一些操作的开销\n\n3.1 How does it work?\nqueue 基于 array 和三个 index：\n\nwriteIndex:新元素要被插入的地方\nreadIndex:下一个被弹出的元素位置\nmaximumReadIndex:上一个已经‘commit’要插入的元素位置。如果与writeIndex位置不同，意味着有写入被挂起，也意味着这个位置已经被声明占用了，但是数据还没有写进去到队列里，所以试图读的线程需要等待数据被填入\n\n值得一提的是，三个index是必要的，因为队列允许多生产者和多消费者。有文章研究了单生产者单消费者，这篇文章值得一读（我一直很喜欢 KISS 原则）。这里的事情变得复杂很多，因为队列必须对于各种线程配置都要线程安全。\n3.1.1 The CAS operation\nLock-free queue 同步机制基于 CAS 的 CPU 指令。CAS 操作已经在 GCC 4.1.0 实现。因此在GCC4.4 版本编译，我采用了 GCC 的 build_in operation: __sync_bool_compare_and_swap（这里是GCC文档），为了移植性考虑，这个操作通过宏定义了 CAS，在atomic_ops.h文件中：\n#define CAS(a_ptr, a_oldVal, a_newVal) __sync_bool_compare_and_swap(a_ptr, a_oldVar, a_newVal)\n\n如果要使用其他编译器或者其他版本，你需要宏定义CAS操作，接口满足如下条件：\n\n第一个是可变的地址参数\n第二个参数是老值\n第三个参数是新值\n成功返回true，否则返回false\n\n\n3.1.2 Inserting elements into the queue\n这是插入元素的代码：\n/* ... */\ntemplate &lt;typename ELEM_T, uint32_t Q_SIZE&gt;\ninline\nuint32_t ArrayLockFreeQueue&lt;ELEM_T, Q_SIZE&gt;::countToIndex(uint32_t a_count)\n{\n    return (a_count % Q_SIZE);\n}\n\n/* ... */\n\ntemplate &lt;typename ELEM_T&gt;\nbool ArrayLockFreeQueue&lt;ELEM_T&gt;::push(const ELEM_T &amp;a_data)\n{\n    uint32_t currentReadIndex;\n    uint32_t currentWriteIndex;\n\n    do\n    {\n        currentWriteIndex = m_writeIndex;\n        currentReadIndex  = m_readIndex;\n        if (countToIndex(currentWriteIndex + 1) ==\n            countToIndex(currentReadIndex))\n        {\n            // the queue is full\n            return false;\n        }\n\n    } while (!CAS(&amp;m_writeIndex, currentWriteIndex, (currentWriteIndex + 1)));\n\n    // We know now that this index is reserved for us.

Someone else must\n        // have read the element stored at countToIndex(currentReadIndex)\n        // before we could perform the CAS operation\n\n    } while(1); // keep looping to try again!\n\n    // Something went wrong. it shouldn't be possible to reach here\n    assert(0);\n\n    // Add this return statement to avoid compiler warnings\n    return false;\n}\n\n还是用插入数据一节的queue的初始状态。有两个元素已经插入队列。\n\n消费线程，从readIndex复制数据，然后尝试在相同的readIndex执行CAS操作。如果线程执行CAS成功，表示数据已经从队列取出，因为CAS是原子的。如果CAS失败，下次尝试就会从新的位置重复这个过程，如下图\n\n结果就是下图\n\n如果这个时候还有线程要读取数据，就会失败，因为队列已空。\n现在一个任务尝试在队列中插入新元素，已经占到了位置但是提交数据被挂起，然后另一个线程想要pop一个元素，现在知道队列不空了，（因为writeIndex != readIndex），但是还不能读取，因为maximumReadIndex != readIndex。这个线程试图pop，将陷入循环中，直到数据被提交让maximumReadIndex == readIndex或者队列称为空（如果另有一个消费线程进来先消费了，然后再次writeIndex == readIndex）\n【译者注：这里原文两个图不贴了，上面文字描述的更清楚】\n\n3.1.4 On the need for yielding the processor when there is more than 1 producer thread\n【译者注：本节详细阐述了push第二次 CAS 是为了保证 FIFO 顺序，这里如果单纯++，会导致数据错乱】\n读者可能注意到了push函数中对于sched_yield的调用出让CPU，对于宣称 lock-free 的算法看起来有点奇怪。正如文章开头就提到的一样，多线程的性能下降原因之一就是cache trashing。典型造成cache trashing就是被强占的线程上下文需要操作系统从cache转移到主存，恢复时又要转移回来。\n当算法调用sched_yield时，就是告诉操作系统：hi，你能把别的任务搞过来吗，我必须等会才能执行。lock-free 和 lock 同步机制的主要区别就是我们不需要阻塞，所以为啥要主动告诉操作系统赶紧抢占我？回答这个问题并不简单，涉及到了生产者将新数据保存到队列中，需要以FIFO 顺序执行两次 CAS 操作，一次申请分配空间，另一次通知消费者数据已经提交。\n如果应用只有一个生产线程，sched_yield就不需要调用了，因为第二次 CAS 绝对不会失败。操作自然就会按照 FIFO 的顺序执行，因为只有一个线程在插入数据\n当大于一个线程插入数据时，问题就来了。如同3.1.2节表述那样插入数据，1CAS已经按照 FIFO 顺序申请空间后，2CAS必须也按照 FIFO 顺序执行。让我们考虑下面的场景，三个生产者一个消费者：\n\n线程1，2，3按照顺序申请空间。2CAS必须按照相同顺序执行，1，2，3\n线程2先开始执行2CAS，但是因为Thread 1还没执行所以失败了，Thread 3也会失败\n2和3线程陷入循环直到线程1执行了2CAS\n线程1执行完之后，线程3必须等2执行\n最终按序执行完\n\n2CAS失败是可能spin也不失为一个好选择。当使用的多处理器机器的处理器数量大于线程数量时，这可能很好：线程卡住一直尝试在volatile variable(maximumReadIndex)上执行CAS操作，但是等待的线程可能分配到物理处理器核心，因此最终比如Thread1可能执行2CAS，自旋的操作也能结束。总而言之，该算法有保留线程循环的可能性，但是要保证这种行为是可行的，在某些特定情况可以删除scheld_yield。事实上，删除scheld_yield才是最好的性能。\n但是scheld_yield对于多个生产者和线程数量大于物理核心数的场景是必要的。考虑之前的问题，当三个线程试图插入新数据到队列中，线程1在分配空间后被抢占，线程2，3会一直死循环直到线程1被唤醒，这就需要sheld_yield，操作系统不比一直让线程2，3保持循环，它们必须尽快阻塞，以让线程1执行2CAS，让自己能够继续执行。\n4. Known issues of the queue\n这个lock-free 队列的主要目的是提供一个不需要动态内存分配的 lock-free 队列，已经搞定，但是算法存在一些已知的缺点，在生产环境中使用该算法应该考虑这些缺点是不是你关注的。\n4.1 Using more than one producer thread\n如同在3.1.4中描述一样（如果你要在多生产者环境中使用这个算法要仔细阅读这一节内容），如果有超过一个生产线程，由于必须按照 FIFO 顺序操作 maximumReadIndex，所以可能多次调用sched_yield导致花费很多开销。这个队列设计的原始场景只有一个生产线程，因此在多生产线程的场景，性能是肯定会下降的。\n此外，如果你计划将此队列用于单生产者线程的场景，不需要第二个 CAS 操作。对于 m_maximumReadIndex的 CAS 可以被删除，所以代码如下：\ntemplate &lt;typename ELEM_T&gt;\nbool ArrayLockFreeQueue&lt;ELEM_T&gt;::push(const ELEM_T &amp;a_data)\n{\n    uint32_t currentReadIndex;\n    uint32_t currentWriteIndex;\n\n    currentWriteIndex = m_writeIndex;\n    currentReadIndex  = m_readIndex;\n    if (countToIndex(currentWriteIndex + 1) ==\n        countToIndex(currentReadIndex))\n    {\n        // the queue is full\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    // save the date into the q\n    m_theQueue[countToIndex(currentWriteIndex)] = a_data;\n\n    // No need to increment write index atomically. It is a \n    // requierement of this queue that only one thred can push stuff in\n    m_writeIndex++;\n\n    return true;\n}\n\ntemplate &lt;typename ELEM_T&gt;\nbool ArrayLockFreeQueue&lt;ELEM_T&gt;::pop(ELEM_T &amp;a_data)\n{\nuint32_t currentMaximumReadIndex;\nuint32_t currentReadIndex;\n\ndo\n{\n    // m_maximumReadIndex doesn't exist when the queue is set up as\n    // single-producer. The maximum read index is described by the current\n    // write index\n    currentReadIndex        = m_readIndex;\n    currentMaximumReadIndex = m_writeIndex;\n\n    if (countToIndex(currentReadIndex) ==\n        countToIndex(currentMaximumReadIndex))\n    {\n        // the queue is empty or\n        // a producer thread has allocate space in the queue but is\n        // waiting to commit the data into it\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    // retrieve the data from the queue\n    a_data = m_theQueue[countToIndex(currentReadIndex)];\n\n    // try to perfrom now the CAS operation on the read index. If we succeed\n    // a_data already contains what m_readIndex pointed to before we\n    // increased it\n    if (CAS(&amp;m_readIndex, currentReadIndex, (currentReadIndex + 1)))\n    {\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    // it failed retrieving the element off the queue. Someone else must\n    // have read the element stored at countToIndex(currentReadIndex)\n    // before we could perform the CAS operation\n\n} while(1); // keep looping to try again!\n\n// Something went wrong. it shouldn't be possible to reach here\nassert(0);\n\n// Add this return statement to avoid compiler warnings\nreturn false;\n}\n\n如果你要在单生产者，单消费者场景使用，再次推荐此文章，用了类似的环形队列设计。\n4.2 Using the queue with smart pointers\n如果队列每个位置保存的是只能指针，请注意，插入队列的元素会由于智能指针的保护不能被完整删除，保存过元素的位置直到被新的智能指针占用才会完全删除这个数据，所以对于繁忙的队列这不是问题，不过开发者要注意的是，一旦队列第一次被占满，应用使用的内存就不会降下去了，即使队列已空【译者注：适配这个场景，要改代码，比如使用偏特化指定smart_pointer data_type要加入多余的处理？】\n4.3 Calculating size of queue\n原始size可能会返回错的size数据\ntemplate &lt;typename ELEM_T&gt;\ninline uint32_t ArrayLockFreeQueue&lt;ELEM_T&gt;::size()\n{\n    uint32_t currentWriteIndex = m_writeIndex;\n    uint32_t currentReadIndex  = m_readIndex;\n\n    if (currentWriteIndex &gt;= currentReadIndex)\n    {\n        return (currentWriteIndex - currentReadIndex);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        return (m_totalSize + currentWriteIndex - currentReadIndex);\n    }\n}\n\n下面的场景会返回错误size：\n\nuint32_t currentWriteIndex = m_writeIndex被执行，m_writeIndex为3，m_readIndex为2，真实的size是1\n这个线程被抢占，当此线程处于非活动状态时，队列中被插入，删除了两个元素，此时m_writeIndex为5，m_readIndex为4，size还是1\n现在线程回来继续执行，uint32_t currentReadIndex = m_readIndex，读取到为4\ncurrentReadIndex &gt; currentWriteIndex，所以返回m_totalSize + currentWriteIndex - currentReadIndex，也就是说当队列几乎为空的时候，返回队列几乎已满\n\n本文上传的代码已经解决了这个问题，加入了一个新的类数据成员，表示当前队列的数据个数，也是用原子操作进行操作。这个方案引入了很大的开销，因为不能被编译器优化，所以原子操作是昂贵的。\n这也是为什么留给开发者选择是否激活这个size变量的原因，取决于应用对于需求的要求，这个size操作是不是必要的，来决定是不是要引入这个开销。编译器会预处理array_lock_free_queue.h调用ARRAY_LOCK_FREE_Q_KEEP_REAL_SIZE定义，来决定size开销是否会激活。如果没有定义就不会激活这个开销，但是函数可能会返回错误size\n5. Compiling the code\n【译者注：本节简单意译】\n这里的代码都是模板代码，所以只需要头文件，不过提供了对应测试代码，是cpp格式。测试代码中使用了 comp，跨平台内存共享并行编程OpenMP 接口的 GNU c/c++实现已经包含在了 GCC4.2 中。OpenMP 是跨平台开发并发程序一个简单灵活的接口。\n所以代码分为了三个部分：\n\n\narray based lock-free queue:\n\n有两个版本的代码，分别在 array_lock_free_queue.h 和 array_lock_free_queue_single_producer.h 中，单生产者版本为场景优化过\n注意，代码没有在64位环境中测试过\n\n\n\nGlib based blocking queue: \n\n首先你的系统中需要有Glib，Linux系统一般已经包含\n使用了glib的 mutex 和 cond variable ，所以编译时要连接上\n\n\n\n测试程序：\n\n\n上面两个部分\n\n\nGNU make 程序\nmake N_PRODUCERS=1 N_CONSUMERS=1 N_ITERATIONS=10000000 QUEUE_SIZE=1000\n\n\nN_PRODUCERS 是生产线程的数量\nN_CONSUMERS 是消费线程的数量\nN_ITERATIONS 是将要插入和弹出元素之和\nQUEUE_SIZE 是队列的最大长度\n\n\n\nGCC版本大于 4.2\n\n\n需要加上OMP_NESTED=TRUE前缀，例如OMP_NESTED=TRUE ./test_lock_free_q\n\n\n\n\n6.

Conclusions\n基于 lock-free 队列的 array 已经被证明了两个版本都是线程安全的，其中一个版本支持多生产者，另一个支持多消费者。队列用在多线程应用作为同步机制是安全的，因为：\n\nCAS 操作是原子的，线程试图并行对队列执行push或者pop操作不会引起死锁\n多个线程同时push元素进queue，不会写入到array同一个位置\n多个线程同时pop元素出queue，不会多次获取到同一个位置元素\nqueue满了不能继续push元素，空了不能pop元素\npush和pop操作都不会导致ABA问题\n\n然而需要注意的是即使算法是线程安全的，它在多个生产者场景中变现也比基于simple block-based queue好。因此，仅在以下两种情况下选择block-based queue才有意义：\n\n只有一个生产者线程（版本2的 single-producer 更快）\n有一个一直繁忙的生产者线程（译者注：一个长时间占用锁的生产者线程），然后我们仍然需要线程安全，因为还是可能会有其他生产者插入进去搞点事情\n\n8.

len);\n\n看起来简单，你可能觉得两次系统调用也不是多大的开销。实际上，远比你想象中的大。这两次系统调用之下，数据拷贝了四次，并且还有内核态和用户态之间的上下文切换（实际上这个进程更复杂，但是先保持这种程度的简化）。为了更好地了解这个进程的调用，看下图\n\n第一步：read 系统调用发生了用户态到内核态的切换。第一次拷贝由DMA执行，从 disk 读取文件内容到内核空间的 buffer\n第二步：数据从内核空间的 buffer 拷贝到用户空间的 buffer，然后 read 系统调用 return。return 又发生了内核态到用户态的切换。现在数据存储在用户态的 buffer 中\n第三步：write 系统调用发生了用户态到内核态的切换。第三次拷贝从用户空间 buffer 到内核空间 buffer，这次内核空间的buffer 与 socket 关联\n第四步：write 系统调用 return，触发了第四次上下文切换。单独异步的拷贝由DMA控制将数据从内核空间的 buffer 拷贝到协议栈中。你可能会问“什么叫独立异步？数据不是在return的时候就传输完成了吗？”事实上，return 并不保证传输完成；甚至不保证传输开始。可能在这次调用之前队列中有很多包，除非硬件驱动实现了优先队列，并且本次数据在第一优先级的队列中\n正如你所看到的，很多数据拷贝实际本不必要发生。有些拷贝可以规避掉来减少开销提升程序性能。对一个驱动开发者，硬件实际有很多增强功能。有些硬件支持 bypass 主存，直接从将数据传输到其他设备。这个特性可以减少系统存储中的拷贝，但并不是所有硬件都支持。还有一个问题就是从disk得到数据需要为了网络重新封装，这带来了复杂性。为了减少开销，我们可以从减少内核空间和用户空间之间的拷贝开始。\nmmap\n一个方法就是避免使用read，而使用 mmap\ntmp_buf = mmap(file, len);\nwrite(socket, tmp_buf, len);\n\n为了更好地理解这个过程，看下图\n\n第一步：mmap 系统调用使得文件内容通过 DMA 从disk 拷贝到内核空间的buffer，这个buffer可以直接在用户空间访问，不需要拷贝到用户空间\n第二步：write 系统调用使得内核将内核空间buffer中的数据拷贝到 socket 关联的内核buffer中\n第三步：第三次拷贝是 DMA 将socket buffer中的数据拷贝到协议栈中\n通过使用 mmap，我们减少了一次使用 CPU 的拷贝。当大量数据传输时这比较有用，但并不是没有代价，有些隐藏的问题其实。当另一个进程也mmap到了同一个文件，然后对其进行了写入操作。上面代码的 write 就会被 SIGBUS 中断。这个信号默认的行为是杀死进程并coredump -- 这个操作对于网络服务器恨不能接受。有两种方法解决这个问题\n第一个是定义一下 SIGBUS 的信号处理程序，直接return。这样 write 系统调用就会返回中断前写入的字节数，然后 errno 被设置为成功。这是个垃圾方案，无视问题，因为 SIGBUS 实际表示进程发生了严重错误，不应该无视\n第二个是使用内核的文件租约（也叫“乐观锁”）。这是正确的解决方案。你可以从内核请求 read/write lease，当另一个进程视图对同一个文件进行截断时，内核会发送 RT_SINGAL_LEASE信号给有租约的进程，告诉你内核正在打断你的租约。你的写请求就会在程序访问无效地址之前被中断而不会导致 SIGBUS。write的返回值就是已经写入的字节数，errno被设置为成功，代码如下\nif (fcntl(fd, F_SETSIG, RT_SIGNAL_LEASE) == -1) {\n  perror(\"kernel lease set signal\");\n  return -1;\n}\n/*l_type can be F_RDLCK F_WRLCK*/\nif (fcntl(fd, F_SETLEASE, l_type)) {\n  peror(\"kernel lease set type\");\n  return -1;\n}\n\n你应该在 mmap file之前获取租约，然后完成写入后主动放弃租约。通过调用 fcntl(F_SETLEASE, F_UNLCK) \nSendfile\n在内核2.1版本，sendfile 系统调用简化了将数据从文件传输到socket的方法，不仅减少了数据拷贝，还减少了内核与用户空间的上下文切换\nsendfile(socket, file, len);\n\n为了更好地理解底层过程，如下图\n\n第一步：sendfile 系统调用使得文件内容通过 DMA 拷贝到内核buffer，然后数据被内核拷贝到 socket buffer\n第二步：第三次拷贝 DMA 控制从 socket buffer 拷贝到协议栈\n你可能想知道如果另一个进程截断了这个文件，sendfile会发生什么。如果没有注册信号处理函数，sendfile 调用会返回已经传输的字节，errno被设置为成功\n如果 sendfile 之前获取了文件租约，行为相同。同时sendfile return前会有 RT_SIGNAL_LEASE 信号\nsendfile + gather(hardware)\n如此说来，我们已经避免了内核进行多次拷贝，但是还有一次拷贝，可以也避免吗？当然，但是需要硬件的支持。为了消除内核的所有拷贝，需要网卡支持 gather 操作。内核2.4版本引入了socket对这种操作的支持，这种方法不需要内核态切换，也不需要处理器进行数据拷贝。同时用户代码不变\nsendfile(socket, file, len);\n\n底层流程如下图\n\n第一步：sendfile 系统调用可以将文件内容通过 DMA 拷贝到内核 buffer\n第二步：没有数据被拷贝到 socket buffer。socket 文件描述符只有数据的长度信息。DMA 直接将数据从kernel buffer 拷贝到协议栈\n因为数据从 disk 到主存的拷贝和从主存到总线的拷贝，有些人觉得这也不是零拷贝。这只是从操作系统角度的零拷贝，因为在操作系统中只有一个buffer。当使用零拷贝时，性能提升还来自，比如更少的内核用户态切换，更少的 CPU cache 污染以及不需要 CPU 校验\n现在我们知道了什么是零拷贝，练习些代码吧。你可以下载完整代码。\n论文\nsplice\nsendfile 只适用于将数据从文件拷贝到socket（依赖于具体实现，linux系统可以从文件到文件），而且使用 gather 需要硬件的支持。Linux 在2.6.17版本中实现了 splice 系统调用，不需要硬件支持，实现了两个文件描述符之间的数据零拷贝。\nCopysplice(fd_in, off_in, fd_out, off_out, len, flags);\n\nsplice 系统调用在内核空间的 buffer 和 socket buffer 之间建立了管道，避免了两者之间的 CPU 拷贝操作\n\n基于 splice 系统调用的零拷贝方式，整个拷贝过程会发生 2 次上下文切换，0 次 CPU 拷贝以及 2 次 DMA 拷贝，用户程序读写数据的流程如下：\n\n用户进程通过 splice() 函数向内核(kernel)发起系统调用，上下文从用户态 (user space) 切换为内核态(kernel space)；\nCPU 利用 DMA 控制器将数据从主存或硬盘拷贝到内核空间 (kernel space) 的读缓冲区 (read buffer)；\nCPU 在内核空间的读缓冲区 (read buffer) 和网络缓冲区(socket buffer)之间建立管道 (pipeline)；\nCPU 利用 DMA 控制器将数据从网络缓冲区 (socket buffer) 拷贝到网卡进行数据传输；\n上下文从内核态 (kernel space) 切换回用户态 (user space)，splice 系统调用执行返回。\n\nsplice 拷贝方式也同样存在用户程序不能对数据进行修改的问题。除此之外，它使用了 Linux 的管道缓冲机制，可以用于任意两个文件描述符中传输数据，但是它的两个文件描述符参数中有一个必须是管道设备。\n写时复制\n在某些情况下，内核缓冲区可能被多个进程所共享，如果某个进程想要这个共享区进行 write 操作，由于 write 不提供任何的锁操作，那么就会对共享区中的数据造成破坏，写时复制的引入就是 Linux 用来保护数据的。\n写时复制指的是当多个进程共享同一块数据时，如果其中一个进程需要对这份数据进行修改，那么就需要将其拷贝到自己的进程地址空间中。这样做并不影响其他进程对这块数据的操作，每个进程要修改的时候才会进行拷贝，所以叫写时拷贝。这种方法在某种程度上能够降低系统开销，如果某个进程永远不会对所访问的数据进行更改，那么也就永远不需要拷贝。\n缺点：\n需要 MMU 的支持，MMU 需要知道进程地址空间中哪些页面是只读的，当需要往这些页面写数据时，发出一个异常给操作系统内核，内核会分配新的存储空间来供写入的需求。\n缓冲区共享\n缓冲区共享方式完全改写了传统的 I/O 操作，传统的 Linux I/O 接口支持数据在应用程序地址空间和操作系统内核之间交换，这种交换操作导致所有的数据都需要进行拷贝。\n如果采用 fbufs 这种方法，需要交换的是包含数据的缓冲区，这样就消除了多余的拷贝操作。应用程序将 fbuf 传递给操作系统内核，这样就能减少传统的 write 系统调用所产生的数据拷贝开销。\n同样的应用程序通过 fbuf 来接收数据，这样也可以减少传统 read 系统调用所产生的数据拷贝开销。\nfbuf 的思想是每个进程都维护着一个缓冲区池，这个缓冲区池能被同时映射到用户空间 (user space) 和内核态 (kernel space)，内核和用户共享这个缓冲区池，这样就避免了一系列的拷贝操作。\n\n缺点：\n缓冲区共享的难度在于管理共享缓冲区池需要应用程序、网络软件以及设备驱动程序之间的紧密合作，而且如何改写 API 目前还处于试验阶段并不成熟。\nLinux零拷贝对比\n无论是传统 I/O 拷贝方式还是引入零拷贝的方式，2 次 DMA Copy 是都少不了的，因为两次 DMA
